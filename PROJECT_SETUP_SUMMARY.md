# Rapid Response Central - Project Setup Summary

## Current Status

I've successfully created a fresh iOS project structure for Rapid Response Central with the following configuration:

### Project Location
```
/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/RapidResponseCentralFresh/
```

### Project Configuration
- **Bundle ID**: `com.virtuavoorhees.rapidresponsecentral`
- **Display Name**: Rapid Response Central
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 17.0
- **Supported Devices**: iPhone and iPad
- **Architecture**: Workspace + Swift Package Manager

### Directory Structure Created
```

## Current Build Issue

There's a code signing issue with the Swift Package bundle resource. This is a common issue that can be resolved by:

### Option 1: Open in Xcode and Configure (Recommended)
1. Open the workspace in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open "/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/RapidResponseCentralFresh/RapidResponseCentral.xcworkspace"
   ```

2. Select the RapidResponseCentral project in the navigator

3. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab

4. For the app target:
   - Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select your development team
   - Or uncheck it and select "Sign to Run Locally" for simulator testing

5. Build and run (⌘+R)

### Option 2: Command Line Build (After Xcode Configuration)
Once signing is configured in Xcode, you can use Claude's MCP tools:

```javascript
// Build and run
build_run_sim_name_ws({
    workspacePath: "/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/RapidResponseCentralFresh/RapidResponseCentral.xcworkspace",
    scheme: "RapidResponseCentral",
    simulatorName: "iPhone 16 Pro Max"
})
```

## Next Steps for Claude Code

1. **Fix Code Signing**:
   - Open project in Xcode first
   - Configure signing settings
   - Close Xcode

2. **Start Development**:
   - All code goes in `RapidResponseCentralPackage/Sources/RapidResponseCentralFeature/`
   - Follow the structure in CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md

3. **Content Migration**:
   - Copy protocol files from the original location
   - Convert to JSON format
   - Place in Resources folder

4. **Build Features**:
   - Emergency Protocols view
   - Clinical Calculators
   - FamMed Central study module

## Important Files Created

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive AI coding guidelines for the project
2. **RAPID_RESPONSE_CENTRAL.md** - Project-specific documentation
3. **CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md** - Step-by-step development guide

## Content Sources to Migrate

Your original content is located at:
- Protocol text: `/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Downloads/IGNITE/RapidResponseCentral/protocol_text_versions/`
- UI References: SmartDr and myEOP screenshots (you'll need to provide these)

## Development Tips

1. **Use the Swift Package**: All feature code goes in the package, not the app target
2. **Follow MV Pattern**: Use SwiftUI's built-in state management, no ViewModels
3. **Test Often**: Use the simulator to verify each feature as you build
4. **Keep It Simple**: Start with basic functionality, then enhance

## Getting Started with Claude Code

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Open in your preferred editor
3. Start with creating the main navigation structure in ContentView.swift
4. Build protocol models based on the text files
5. Create views following the SmartDr style

The project is now ready for development. The only remaining step is to configure code signing in Xcode, which needs to be done manually due to Apple's security requirements.
