# Screenshot Feedback Agent - Analysis Plan

## My Role & Responsibilities
As the Screenshot Feedback Agent, I must:

1. ✅ **Take screenshots after EVERY UI change** using available MCP tools
2. ✅ **Analyze screenshots for compliance** with specific requirements
3. ✅ **Provide immediate feedback** to other agents
4. ✅ **Document visual progress** in feedback logs

## Requirements to Validate in Screenshots
- ❌ **No horizontal scrolling** in flowcharts
- ❌ **Cards fit within their panels** 
- ❌ **Emergency Support Card visible at bottom**
- ❌ **45/50/5 layout proportions**
- ❌ **Arrows visible between nodes**
- ❌ **No emojis anywhere**
- ❌ **Clean, efficient use of screen space**

## Current Status: Establishing Baseline

### Known Project Components (from initial file reading):
1. **EmergencyHomeView.swift**: 
   - Grid-based layout with 2-column emergency protocol cards
   - Search bar at top
   - EmergencySupportCard at bottom
   - Uses LazyVGrid with flexible columns

2. **EmergencySupportCard.swift**:
   - Swipeable TabView with 2 pages
   - Page 1: RRT Initial Steps
   - Page 2: Emergency Phone Numbers
   - Height: 140px with page indicator
   - Uses .ultraThinMaterial background

### Next Actions:
1. **Build the app** to get initial screenshots
2. **Identify MCP screenshot tool** (likely mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__screenshot)
3. **Capture baseline images** of current state
4. **Analyze compliance** with each requirement
5. **Create feedback loop** for other agents

### Build Commands Prepared:
- Created `execute_build.sh` with xcodebuild commands
- Target: iPhone 16 Pro Max Simulator
- Configuration: Debug
- Scheme: RapidResponseCentral

### MCP Tool Investigation:
- Need to identify exact function name for screenshots
- Possible names: `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__screenshot`, `Screenshot`, `simulator_screenshot`
- Will test multiple variations

## Critical Screenshots Needed:
1. **Emergency Home View** - Baseline grid layout
2. **Emergency Support Card** - Bottom placement validation
3. **Protocol Detail View** - Flowchart layout analysis
4. **Individual Cards** - Sizing and fit validation

## Analysis Template for Each Screenshot:
```markdown
### Screenshot Analysis: [View Name]
**Date**: [Date]
**Compliance Status**:
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Cards fit panels
- [ ] Support card at bottom
- [ ] Correct proportions

## Success Criteria:
- ✅ All 7 requirements validated as compliant
- ✅ Visual feedback provided after each change
- ✅ Screenshots captured for all major views
- ✅ Documentation complete and updated
