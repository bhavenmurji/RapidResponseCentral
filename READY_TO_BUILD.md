# ✅ Rapid Response Central - Ready for Development!

## Project Status: READY TO BUILD

The iOS project is now successfully set up and running! Here's what you need to know:

### Project Details
- **Location**: `/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/RapidResponseCentralFresh/`
- **Bundle ID**: `com.virtuavoorhees.rapidresponsecentral`
- **App Running**: Successfully on iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator

### Quick Build & Run Commands

```javascript
// Build and run the app
build_run_sim_name_ws({
    workspacePath: "/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/RapidResponseCentralFresh/RapidResponseCentral.xcworkspace",
    scheme: "RapidResponseCentral",
    simulatorName: "iPhone 16 Pro Max"
})

// Just build
build_sim_name_ws({
    workspacePath: "/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Development/RapidResponseCentralFresh/RapidResponseCentral.xcworkspace",
    scheme: "RapidResponseCentral",
    simulatorName: "iPhone 16 Pro Max"
})
```

### Development Location
All your code goes here:
```
RapidResponseCentralPackage/Sources/RapidResponseCentralFeature/
├── ContentView.swift      # Main entry point (currently shows "Hello, World!")
├── Models/               # Put protocol data models here
├── Views/                # Put UI components here
├── Services/             # Put data loading logic here
├── Protocols/            # Put Swift protocols here
└── Resources/            # Put JSON files and assets here
```

### Next Steps for Claude Code

1. **Start with ContentView.swift** - Replace "Hello, World!" with tab navigation
2. **Create Protocol Models** - Define data structures for medical protocols
3. **Build Protocol List View** - Show all available protocols
4. **Add Protocol Detail View** - Display protocol steps and critical actions
5. **Implement Search** - Add search functionality
6. **Add Calculators** - Create medical calculator views
7. **Build FamMed Central** - Add study module

### Content to Migrate
Your protocol content is located at:
```
/Users/bhavenmurji/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Downloads/IGNITE/RapidResponseCentral/protocol_text_versions/
```

Files to process:
- bradycardia_extracted.txt
- tachycardia_extracted.txt
- hypoxia_extracted.txt
- hypotension_extracted.txt
- heart_failure_extracted.txt
- fever_extracted.txt
- calculators_protocols.md

### Important Notes
1. **Resources**: When you add JSON files or images, uncomment the resources line in Package.swift
2. **Public Access**: All types exposed to the app need `public` modifier
3. **Testing**: Run the app frequently to verify changes
4. **Style**: Follow SmartDr's clean, medical-grade UI style

The project is now fully functional and ready for feature development!
