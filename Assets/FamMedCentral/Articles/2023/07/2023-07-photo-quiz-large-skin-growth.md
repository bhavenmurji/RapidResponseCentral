        Large Skin Growth in a Middle-Aged Man
                Natalia Lapko, MD, and​Tu Le, DO, St Luke’s Family Medicine Residency, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania


            A 45-year-old man presented with a large
            skin growth on his back. The growth had been                              FIGURE 1
            gradually enlarging since he first noticed it four
            years earlier. He had multiple similar, but smaller,
            growths around his eyes, neck, and upper back.
            His medical history included morbid obesity,
            hypertension, and recurrent gout.  
               Physical examination confirmed a peduncu-
            lated growth below his right scapula. The cauli-
            flower dome was 3 cm in diameter, supported on
            a 1-cm stalk (Figure 1).

            Question
            Based on the patient’s history and physical
            examination findings, which one of the follow-
            ing is the most likely diagnosis?
                A. Dermatofibroma.  
                B. Dermatosis papulosa nigra.
                C. Fibroepithelial polyp.
                D. Seborrheic keratosis.
