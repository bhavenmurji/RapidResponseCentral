• Wash hands often.
• Breastfeed your baby for at least six months.            Notes from your family doctor
• Keep your child away from secondhand smoke,
  which can increase the risk and severity of RSV.
• Talk to your doctor about a special medicine to
  prevent RSV if your baby was born before 29
  weeks or was born with heart problems. Toddlers
  younger than two years may also get the treatment
  if they were born with certain lung problems.

When should I take my child back to the doctor?
Talk to your child’s doctor if your child has trouble
eating or drinking, gets tired during feeding, or
becomes sluggish. You should also see a doctor if
your child is younger than 60 days and has a fever
of at least 100.4°F (38°C), or if your child is having
trouble breathing (such as taking 60 breaths or more
per minute). See a doctor if your child seems to be
getting worse.

Where can I get more information?
