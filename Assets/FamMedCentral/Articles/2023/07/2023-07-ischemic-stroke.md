                Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ischemic stroke and transient
                ischemic attack exist on a continuum of the same disease process. Ischemic stroke is common, and
                more than 85% of stroke risk is attributed to modifiable risk factors. The initial management of acute
                stroke is usually performed in the emergency department and hospital settings. Family physicians
                have a key role in follow-up, ensuring that a complete diagnostic evaluation has been performed,
                addressing modifiable risk factors, facilitating rehabilitation, and managing chronic sequelae. Sec-
                ondary prevention of ischemic stroke includes optimization of chronic disease management (e.g.,
                hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia), nonpharmacologic lifestyle interventions (e.g.,
                diet changes, exercise, substance use counseling), and pharmacologic interventions. Dual antiplate-
                let therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is generally indicated for minor noncardioembolic ischemic
                strokes and high-risk transient ischemic attacks and should be converted to single antiplatelet therapy
                after 21 to 90 days. Secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke requires long-term anticoagulation.
                Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred over warfarin for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
                Poststroke problems with mobility, balance, cognition, dysphagia, and depression are common. Reha-
                bilitation involves a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach that includes physical therapy, speech
                therapy, and treatment of chronic pain and poststroke depression. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(1):70-

             Ischemic stroke is the result of a sudden block- to a minor, nondisabling stroke. In this article,
             age of blood flow to the central nervous system                       TIA is included with ischemic stroke, except
             due to thrombotic or embolic phenomena, and                           where noted.

                                nuts, seeds, fish, and use of extra virgin olive oil;​may include low to moderate consumption of red

                                TIA/stroke who are capable of exercise:​engage in at least 10 minutes of exercise 4 times per week,
                                or 20 minutes 2 times per week, to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence

                                U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines recommend 1 of the following:​
                                  A minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise
                                  A minimum of 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity
                                  An equivalent weekly combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, plus
                                  muscle strengthening activity of at least moderate intensity at least 2 days per week
                                Adults unable to meet the guidelines above due to chronic conditions or disability (e.g., poststroke)
                                should avoid inactivity and engage in physical activity, as tolerated, according to their abilities
                                Engaging in physical activity may reduce pain and improve cardiovascular fitness, physical func-

   Smoking cessation            Evidence supports a combination of behavior intervention and pharmacologic treatment;​patients

   Avoidance of heavy           Heavy alcohol use, which is associated with increased risk of stroke, is defined as > 4 drinks per
