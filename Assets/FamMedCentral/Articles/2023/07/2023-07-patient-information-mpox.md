                     Mpox: What You Need to Know (continued)
Are there treatments?
                                                         Notes from your family doctor
Most of the time your body can fight the virus
without medicine. No treatments are approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for mpox.
Because smallpox and mpox are similar, some
smallpox treatments are being used for mpox. Ask
your doctor whether you should take medicine for
treatment or get the vaccine.
   An mpox infection is over when you can no longer
see a rash and the skin under the rash has healed.

Questions for your doctor:
• Am I at high risk of getting mpox?
• Do I qualify for the vaccine to prevent mpox?
• How do I know if I’m at risk for severe disease?

Where can I get more information?
