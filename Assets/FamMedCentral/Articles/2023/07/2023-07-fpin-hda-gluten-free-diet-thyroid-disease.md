             Clinical Inquiries provides answers to questions submitted by practicing family physicians to the Family
             Physicians Inquiries Network (FPIN). Members of the network select questions based on their relevance
             to family medicine. Answers are drawn from an approved set of evidence-based resources and undergo
             peer review. The strength of recommendations and the level of evidence for individual studies are rated
             using criteria developed by the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group (https://www.cebm.net).
