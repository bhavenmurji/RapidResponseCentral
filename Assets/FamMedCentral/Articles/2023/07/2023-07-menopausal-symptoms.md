  Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause are vaso-
  motor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary
  problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone
  therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medica-
  tions for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
  serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and fezolinetant,
  which is a neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist. [updated] Selective serotonin
  reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen.
  Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term
  reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are
  lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such
  as herbal or botanical supplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free
  vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating
  genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal

  dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and
  intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Management of menopausal symptoms
  should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

DHEA = dehydroepiandrosterone; SNRI = serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
*—There are limited data for the effectiveness of these treatments.
†—Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as of May 12, 2023; neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist. Monitor for hepatic injury with serum
alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin levels at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months after start. Do not start in patients with alanine
transaminase, aspartate transaminase, or bilirubin levels more than twice the upper limit of normal. Contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis, esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate < 30, or those using cytochrome P450 1A2 inhibitor medications.
‡—Consider adding progestin if the patient has an intact uterus.
