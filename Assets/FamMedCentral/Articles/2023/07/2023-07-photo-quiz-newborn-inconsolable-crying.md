              A Newborn With Inconsolable Crying
                     Shabih Manzar, MD, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana


            A newborn was admitted to the nursery follow-
            ing an assisted delivery. The 24-year-old mother                          FIGURE 1
            (primigravida) had an uneventful pregnancy.
            After delivery, the newborn had inconsolable cry-
            ing and intermittent tachypnea. She was placed on
            pulse oximetry. The nurse reported a heart rate of
            140 beats per minute, with an oxygen saturation
            of 99% on room air. The family medicine resident
            was called to the bedside.
               On examination, the chest was clear to auscul-
            tation. No cardiac murmur or radiofemoral delay
            were present. The infant had normal tone in all
            extremities. Blood pressure measurements in all
            four extremities were similar. Chest radiography
            was performed (Figure 1).

            Question
            Based on the patient’s history and physical
            examination findings, which one of the follow-
            ing is the best course of action?
               l A.	Counsel and reassure the parents.
               l B.	Obtain urgent echocardiography.
               l C.	Perform complete workup for sepsis.
               l D.	Transfer patient to the neonatal inten-
                     sive care unit.

   GLOSSARY OF EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE AND STATISTICAL TERMS

   Term                    Definition

   Sensitivity             Percentage of patients with disease who have a positive test for the disease in question
   Specificity             Percentage of patients without disease who have a negative test for the disease in question
   Predictive value        Percentage of patients with a positive or negative test for a disease who do or do not have the disease
   (positive [PV+] and     in question
   negative [PV–])
   Pretest probability     Probability of disease before a test is performed
   Post-test probability   Probability of disease after a test is performed
   Likelihood ratio (LR)   LR > 1 indicates an increased likelihood of disease, LR < 1 indicates a decreased likelihood of disease.
                           The most helpful tests generally have a ratio of less than 0.2 or greater than 5.
   Relative risk reduc-    The percentage difference in risk or outcomes between treatment and control groups. Example: if
   tion (RRR)              mortality is 30% in controls and 20% with treatment, RRR is (30 – 20)/30 = 33%.
   Absolute risk reduc-    The arithmetic difference in risk or outcomes between treatment and control groups. Example: if
   tion (ARR)              mortality is 30% in controls and 20% with treatment, ARR is 30 – 20 = 10%.
   Number needed to        The number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the alternative in order for one
   treat (NNT)             additional patient to benefit. The NNT is calculated as: 1/ARR. Example: if the ARR is 4%, the NNT =
                           1/4% = 1/0.04 = 25.
   Number needed to        The number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the alternative in order for one
   harm (NNH)              additional patient to experience an adverse event.
   95% CI                  An estimate of certainty. It is 95% certain that the true value lies within the given range. A narrow CI is
                           good. A CI that spans 1.0 calls into question the validity of the result.
   Systematic review       A type of review article that uses explicit methods to comprehensively analyze and qualitatively syn-
                           thesize information from multiple studies
   Meta-analysis           A type of systematic review that uses rigorous statistical methods to quantitatively synthesize the
                           results of multiple similar studies
