   SCREENING FOR SKIN CANCER: CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

   What does the USPSTF         For adolescents and adults who do not have signs or symptoms of skin cancer:
   recommend?                   The USPSTF found the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms
                                of visual skin examination by a clinician to screen for skin cancer.
                                Grade: I statement

   To whom does the             This recommendation applies to adolescents and adults who do not have signs or symptoms of
   recommendation               skin cancer.
   apply?                       It does not apply to persons with a personal or family history of skin cancer.
                                It does not apply to persons with symptoms, such as changes in size, shape, or color of skin
                                growths or irregular moles.

   What’s new?                  This recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation.

   How to implement             There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer in adoles-
   this recommendation?         cents and adults. The USPSTF is calling for more research on the effectiveness of screening for
                                skin cancer in populations with a diversity of skin tones and for studies assessing the accuracy of
                                risk assessment tools and the impact of social determinants of health.
                                Clinicians should use their judgment when deciding whether to screen for skin cancer.

   What additional              There are 2 main types of skin cancer: melanoma and keratinocyte carcinoma, which consists of
   information should           basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Keratinocyte carcinoma is more common, but melanoma
   clinicians know about        causes more deaths.
   this recommendation?         Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure, indoor tanning beds, and other ultraviolet
                                radiation–emitting devices is the major environmental risk factor for skin cancer.
                                A history of frequent sunburns, older age, and male sex are associated with increased risk for skin
                                cancer.
                                Melanoma is about 30 times more common in White persons than in Black persons. However, per-
                                sons with darker skin color are often diagnosed at later stages, when skin cancer is more difficult
                                to treat. Several factors may contribute to these disparities, including differences in risk factors,
                                access to care, and clinical presentation.
                                The most common type of melanoma among Black persons occurs mostly on skin not frequently
                                exposed to direct sunlight, such as palms of hands, soles of feet, or under fingernails or toenails.
                                                                                                                                       continues

   Note: The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence
   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   SCREENING FOR SKIN CANCER: CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)

   Why are this recom-          Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States; however, most skin cancers
   mendation and topic          do not cause serious health problems or death.
   important?                   Melanoma constitutes about 1% of skin cancers. An estimated 98,000 new cases of melanoma will
                                be diagnosed in the United States in 2023, with 8000 associated deaths.
                                There are many preventive behaviors persons can take to reduce skin cancer risk, such as minimiz-
                                ing sun exposure, protecting their skin when in the sun, and avoiding tanning beds.

                                data for melanoma incidence and mortality, ultraviolet radiation levels, and other risk factors.
                                These geographic-specific data can help communities better meet their unique melanoma pre-
