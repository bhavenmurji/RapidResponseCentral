                            Childhood Eye Examination
                                 in Primary Care

                Approximately 7% of children in the United States younger than 18 years have a diagnosed eye dis-
                order, and 1 in 4 children between two and 17 years of age wears glasses. Routine eye examinations
                during childhood can identify abnormalities necessitating referral to ophthalmology, which optimizes
                children’s vision through the early diagnosis and treatment of abnormalities. The U.S. Preventive Ser-
                vices Task Force recommends vision screening at least once in children three to five years of age to
                detect amblyopia or its risk factors to improve visual acuity. The American Academy of Family Phy-
                sicians supports this recommendation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening
                starting at three years of age and at regular intervals in childhood, and that instrument-based screen-
                ing (e.g., photoscreening, autorefraction) is an alternative to vision charts for testing visual acuity in
                patients three to five years of age. Eye examinations include visual acuity testing, external examina-
                tions, assessing ocular alignment and pupillary response, and assessing for opacities with the red reflex
                examination. Common abnormalities include refractive errors, amblyopia (reduction in visual acuity
                in one eye not attributable to structural abnormality), and strabismus (misalignment of the eye). Rare
                diagnoses include retinoblastoma (often detectable through loss of red reflex), cataracts (detectable
                by an abnormal red reflex), and glaucoma (often manifests as light sensitivity with corneal cloudiness
                and enlargement). (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(1):40-50. Copyright © 2023 American Academy of Fam-

   six months. If results are inconclusive on retesting or if retesting cannot be performed, referral for a comprehensive eye evaluation is indicated.

   screening is useful for young children and those with developmental delays. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends instrument-based
   screening to assess risk at 12 and 24 months of age, and at well-child examinations for children three to five years of age.7,8

Cover and cover-uncover tests assess for strabismus. Tro-
pia is a deviation of the eye, also known as manifest stra-
bismus, whereas phoria is latent strabismus. An exophoria
is a type of strabismus that is evident only temporarily
when the child is stressed or tired. An exotropia is a type
of strabismus that occurs more frequently and is often
more noticeable than other types of strabismus. The exam-
