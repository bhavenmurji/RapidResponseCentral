  Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is a DNA virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus, similar to smallpox. Although mpox was endemic to
  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and parts of Africa, increasing numbers of cases were reported worldwide in 2022.
  More than 30,000 cases have been reported in the United States, and worldwide 98% of cases are found in men who have sex
  with men. Transmission is primarily through contact with skin lesions. The rash of mpox is often vesiculopustular and may
  be localized to the anogenital region or distributed on the face, trunk, limbs, palms, and soles. Two vaccines are available
  for pre- or postexposure prophylaxis. Jynneos (smallpox and mpox vaccine, live, nonreplicating) is a live, attenuated vaccine
  that is safe for patients who are immunocompromised. ACAM2000 (smallpox [vaccinia] vaccine, live) is a live vaccinia virus
  vaccine that should be given only to immunocompetent, nonpregnant people and should be avoided in those with skin
  conditions such as atopic dermatitis. For most people infected with mpox, the disease is mild and self-limiting. Antiviral treat-
  ments such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, or brincidofovir may be considered for use in individuals who have or are at high risk of
  severe disease. Possible complications of mpox include anogenital pain, bacterial superinfections of skin lesions, dehydra-
  tion secondary to oral lesions, encephalitis, keratitis, and respiratory distress. To date, 38 deaths have been reported in the
  United States. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(1):78-83. Copyright © 2023 American Academy of Family Physicians.)
