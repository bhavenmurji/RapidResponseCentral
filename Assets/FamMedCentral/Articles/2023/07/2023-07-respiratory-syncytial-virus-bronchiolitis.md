                Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in young children. Respiratory syn-
                cytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis. RSV is spread through respiratory
                droplets, and the number of cases varies with season. For most patients, standard precautions (e.g.,
                hand hygiene, surface cleaning, avoiding contact with sick individuals) are recommended. However,
                prophylaxis with palivizumab may be considered for infants at high risk. Initial symptoms occur after
                an incubation period of four to six days and include rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, and fever. Signs
                of lower respiratory tract involvement may follow and include cough, tachypnea, retractions, diffi-
                culty feeding, and accessory muscle use. Diagnosis is typically clinical;​routine use of radiography or
                viral testing is not recommended. Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Oxygen satu-
                ration should be maintained above 90%. Hydration and nutrition should be maintained by nasogastric
                or intravenous routes, if needed. Therapies such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulized hyper-
                tonic saline, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy are not recommended. Although
                most episodes of RSV bronchiolitis are self-limited, some children have an increased risk of asthma
                later in life. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(1):52-57. Copyright © 2023 American Academy of Family
