             This is the first year we are presenting the
             American Family Physician (AFP) Article of the
             Year Award, which is selected based on the most
             online views and highest ratings from the AFP
             editors. Previously, AFP annually presented the
             Walter Kemp Award from 1986 to 2001, and we
             are pleased to reintroduce the practice of honor-
             ing authors for their excellent scholarly contribu-
             tions to family medicine.
