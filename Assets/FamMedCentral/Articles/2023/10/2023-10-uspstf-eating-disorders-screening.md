              SCREENING FOR EATING DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS:​CLINICAL
              SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

              What does              For adolescents and adults (10 years or older):​
              the USPSTF             The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screen-
              recommend?             ing for eating disorders (e.g., binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia
                                     nervosa) in adolescents and adults.
                                     Grade:​I statement

              To whom does           Adolescents and adults 10 years or older who have no signs or symptoms of
              the recommen-          eating disorders (e.g., rapid weight loss, weight gain, or pronounced devia-

                                     amenorrhea).

              What’s new?            This is a new USPSTF recommendation;​the USPSTF has not previously made a
                                     recommendation on this topic.

              How to imple-          There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routinely screening for
              ment this              eating disorders in persons not showing signs or symptoms of an eating disorder.
              recommenda-            More research is needed on the benefits and harms of screening all adolescents
              tion?                  and adults for eating disorders.
                                     Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors, signs, and symptoms of eating
                                     disorders, listen to any patient concerns about eating, and make sure that persons
                                     who need help get it. The decision to screen should be based on each patient’s
                                     individual risk factors and circumstances.
                                                                                                                   continues

              Note:​The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians
              should understand the evidence but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

             SCREENING FOR EATING DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS:​CLINICAL
             SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)

             What additional        The USPSTF determined there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance
             information            of benefits and harms of screening for eating disorders. In deciding whether to
             should clinicians      screen, clinicians may consider the following.
             know about this         Potential preventable burden:​Eating disorders may affect many organ systems
             recommenda-             (such as musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, endocrine, or gastrointestinal systems).
             tion?                   Eating disorders may also be associated with disturbances in cognitive and
                                     emotional functioning and psychiatric conditions. Persons with eating disorders
                                     also have higher mortality rates than the general population.
                                     Potential harms:​Potential harms of screening questionnaires include
                                     false-positive screening results that lead to unnecessary referrals, treatment,
                                     labeling, anxiety, and stigma. Pharmacologic treatments may result in adverse
                                     events such as dry mouth, headache, insomnia, nausea, and tremor.
                                     Current practice:​Assessing weight, height, and body mass index is the standard
                                     of care in primary care settings, and changes in growth or weight may result in
                                     the detection of some eating disorders.
                                     Assessment of risk:​Higher prevalence of eating disorders is found among ath-
                                     letes, females, younger adults aged 18 to 29 years, and transgender individuals.
                                     Eating disorders also vary by race and ethnicity. Various biological, psycholog-
                                     ical, social, and environmental factors, such as trauma, childhood adversity,
                                     perfectionism, rigidity, social pressure related to appearance, the presence of
                                     other mental health conditions, and genetics are associated with a higher risk.

             Why are this           Screening for eating disorders has the potential to improve health outcomes, such
             recommenda-            as quality of life or function, if it leads to early detection and effective treatment.
             tion and topic         However, the current evidence on whether screening improves health outcomes
             important?             is unclear.
