       of the USPSTF Recommendation

   SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

   What does the USPSTF         Persons who plan to or could become pregnant:​
   recommend?                   Take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 μg) of folic acid.
                                Grade:​ A

   apply?                       who are at very high risk due to other factors such as family history or those taking medication
                                known to block the function of folic acid.

   What’s new?                  This recommendation is consistent with the 2017 USPSTF recommendation.

   How to implement             All persons who are planning to or could become pregnant should take a daily supplement or
   this recommendation?         multivitamin containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 μg) of folic acid.

   How often?                   Supplementation should be taken daily. The critical period for folic acid supplementation starts at
                                least 1 month before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy.
                                Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, meaning that many persons may
                                not know they are pregnant during the crucial time. To gain the full benefits of supplementation,
                                clinicians should advise all persons who plan to or who could become pregnant to take a daily
                                folic acid supplement.

   Why are this recom-          Neural tube defects are caused by a failure of closure of the embryonic neural tube, which results

                                Neural tube defects are among the most common congenital malformations in the United States,
                                with an estimated 3000 pregnancies affected each year. Neural tube defects can result in death
                                and a range of disabilities affecting children.
                                Daily supplementation with folic acid is shown to prevent neural tube defects.
