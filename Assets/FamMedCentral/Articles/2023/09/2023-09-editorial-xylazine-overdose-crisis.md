            Xylazine (street name tranq or tranq dope when                       xylazine exposure, including delayed diagnosis

            recreational drugs such as fentanyl and heroin                       National Drug Control Policy to name xylazine
            to intensify and prolong the euphoria induced by                     as an emerging threat.14 This designation allocates
            these opioids.1 It has a variable duration of action                 new federal funds for “testing, treatment, harm
