              apply?                       It does not apply to persons with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum
                                           production, difficulty breathing, or wheezing.
                                           It does not apply to populations at very high risk for COPD, such as persons
                                           with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or workers exposed to certain toxins at
                                           their job.

              What’s new?                  This recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation.

              How to implement             Do not screen for COPD in patients with no symptoms.
              this recommendation?         Clinicians can help reduce patients’ risk for COPD by supporting them in not
                                           starting to smoke and helping them quit if they do.

              What additional              Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD.
              information should           COPD is most common in Native American/Alaska Native populations, likely
              clinicians know about        due to the effects of societal challenges and high smoking rates.
              this recommendation?
                                           Death from chronic lower respiratory disease (mostly COPD) is highest in
                                           White adults.
                                           Black adults have more hospitalizations and worse COPD-related quality of
                                           life than White adults, despite having lower prevalence of COPD than White
                                           adults.

                                           Progression to severe disease can prevent participation in normal activi-
