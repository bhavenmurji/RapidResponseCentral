           As described by Griggs and colleagues, “PROMs
         [patient-reported outcome measures] are power-
         ful tools that can bridge the need for data-driven
         patient information while also strengthening the
         physician-patient connection. When maximized
         in clinical settings, PROMs can be leveraged
         to inform clinical decision making, to improve
         quality of care, and to foster communication
         between patients and providers. PROMs are a
         tool for patient-provider communication and
         have the potential to be as valuable to the clini-
         cal encounter as a stethoscope is to the physical
         examination.”1
