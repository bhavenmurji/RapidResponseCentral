   recommend?                   Screen for LTBI in populations at increased risk.

   apply?

   What’s new?                  This recommendation replaces and is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on LTBI
                                screening.
                                In 2016, the USPSTF recommended screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk
                                (B recommendation).

   How to implement             Populations at increased risk for LTBI, based on increased prevalence of active disease and
   this recommendation?         increased risk of exposure, include persons who were born in, or are former residents of, countries
                                with high TB prevalence and persons who live in, or have lived in, high-risk congregate settings
                                (e.g., homeless shelters or correctional facilities).
                                Clinicians can consult their local or state health departments for more information about popula-
                                tions at increased risk in their community because local demographic patterns may vary across the
                                United States.
                                Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the United States:​the TST and the
                                IGRA.
                                  The TST requires trained personnel to administer intradermal purified protein derivative and
                                  interpret the response 48 to 72 hours later.
                                  The IGRA requires a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response to spe-
                                  cific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after
                                  collection.
                                                                                                                                   continues

   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   SCREENING FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS IN ADULTS:​CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF
   RECOMMENDATION (continued)

   How to implement             Testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccina-
   this recommendation?         tion, as IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine, and for persons who may be unlikely to return
                                for TST interpretation.
                                The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI.
                                In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk
                                factors;​screening frequency could range from 1-time-only screening among persons at low risk
                                for future TB exposure to annual screening among those who are at continued risk of exposure.
                                Additional examinations, diagnostics, and tests (i.e., medical history, physical examination, chest
                                radiograph, and other laboratory tests) are essential to completing a diagnosis of LTBI.
                                Current recommendations for the treatment of LTBI are available from the CDC.

   What additional              TB disproportionately affects Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, and
   information should           Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons. Incidence of TB varies by geography and living accom-
   clinicians know about        modations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.
   this recommendation?         LTBI is an infection with M. tuberculosis in which the bacteria are alive but contained by the
                                immune system. Persons with LTBI have no apparent symptoms, do not feel sick, cannot spread
                                TB to others, and usually have a positive TB skin test or positive TB blood test reaction.
                                Active TB or TB disease is an illness in which TB bacteria are multiplying and attacking a part of the
                                body, usually the lungs. TB disease may be symptomatic (including weakness, weight loss, fever,
                                no appetite, chills, sweating at night, bad cough, pain in the chest, or coughing up blood). A per-
                                son with TB disease may be infectious and spread TB bacteria to others.

   Why are this recom-          Approximately 30% of persons exposed to M. tuberculosis will develop LTBI, and, if left untreated,
   mendation and topic          approximately 5% to 10% of healthy, immunocompetent persons will progress to active TB disease.

                                Also, the CDC’s “Think. Test. Treat TB” campaign offers community and clinician information to
                                help inform and guide patient and clinician conversations and other LTBI communications (https://​
