          defensive behavior, including stinging.2
             Our recommendations in Table 4 were intended
          for patients looking to avoid Hymenoptera stings,
          particularly those with life-threatening allergies
          to their venom. Although we generally agree that
          spending time in nature is positive for mental
          health, our patients’ health and lifestyle priorities
          are not homogenous. Family physicians are ide-
          ally positioned to best understand their patient’s
          needs and individualize recommendations
          through shared decision-making.
