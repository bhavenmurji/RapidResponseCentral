  Joint and soft tissue injections can be divided into two primary categories:​diagnostic and therapeutic. Diagnostic injections
  facilitate a diagnosis by using a local anesthetic to identify the site of pain or through fluid aspiration for analysis. Therapeutic
  injections are categorized by the type of injectate and include corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, dextrose prolotherapy, and
  platelet-rich plasma. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections are most accurate under direct visualization. Corticosteroid injec-
  tions help treat adhesive capsulitis and tenosynovitis but are not recommended for intratendinous injections. Hyaluronic
  acid has limited benefits for knee osteoarthritis. Dextrose prolotherapy injections treat tendinopathy and degenerative joint
  pain. Platelet-rich plasma injections effectively treat common extensor tendinopathy and knee arthritis;​however, the evi-
  dence does not support its use for other soft tissue injuries. Preparation for injections includes patient education, consent,
  proper patient positioning, and obtaining the necessary supplies. Local infection, fractures, and allergy to injection sub-
  strates are contraindications to joint and soft tissue injections. Potential complications include pain, swelling, and redness.
  Corticosteroid injections into soft tissue may cause atrophy and depigmentation, and repeated injections can cause cartilage
  and tendon degeneration. Optimizing conservative, noninjection treatments, such as oral and topical analgesics, activity
  modification, or rehabilitation, is also important. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(2):​151-158. Copyright © 2023 American Acad-

Patient and injection preparation is important for
procedural success.4,5 Patient preparation involves
a detailed overview of the procedure, informed
consent, and proper positioning. The available
evidence suggests that washing hands, using
nonsterile gloves, and cleansing the skin with
alcohol before an injection is safe and inexpen-
sive, with safety outcomes comparable to a sterile
technique.61 Table 4 provides a basic supply list.2
Figure 2 provides a visual example of a tray setup

be maintained by avoiding direct manipulation of
