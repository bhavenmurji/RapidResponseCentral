            A 44-year-old woman presented to the emer-
            gency department with a two-day history of lower                          FIGURE 1
            lip swelling. She had pain and warmth in her lip
            but no fever, chills, or other symptoms. She had
            recently completed a course of trimethoprim/
            sulfamethoxazole for a urinary tract infection.
            Although she had a history of similar lower lip
            swelling after angiotensin-converting enzyme
            inhibitor use, she said she had not taken them
            recently. She had no history of fillers or other cos-
            metic treatments to the lip or face.
               She was afebrile on physical examination. Her
            lower lip was edematous, and tense and tender
            to palpation. The exposed mucosa was dry and
            cracked, with scabbed-over skin just caudal to the
            vermilion border (Figure 1). Enlarged, mildly ten-
            der lymph nodes were palpable in her neck.

            Question
            Based on the patient’s history and physical
            examination findings, which one of the follow-
            ing is the most likely diagnosis?
               l A.	Angioedema.
               l B.	Cutaneous sarcoidosis.
               l C.	Lip abscess.
               l D.	Type I hypersensitivity reaction.
