                            Food Allergies:​Diagnosis,
                            Treatment, and Prevention

               In the United States, approximately 2% to 3% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy. Allergic
               reactions range from minor pruritus to life-threatening anaphylaxis. These allergies often lead to sig-
               nificant anxiety and costs for patients and caregivers. Common food allergies include peanuts, cow’s
               milk, shellfish, tree nuts, egg, fish, soy, and wheat. Peanut allergy, the most common, is the leading
               cause of life-threatening anaphylaxis. Children with asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or an
               allergy to insect venom, medications, or latex are at an increased risk of developing food allergies.
               Diagnosis of food allergy starts with a detailed, allergy-focused history. Serum immunoglobulin E and
               skin prick testing provide reliable information regarding food allergy diagnoses. Primary treatment
               involves elimination of the offending food from the diet. Prevention strategies proven to decrease the
               risk of developing a food allergy include restricting exposure to cow’s milk in the first three days of
               life and early sequential exposure to allergenic foods starting between four and six months of age.
               Exclusive breastfeeding for three to four months reduces the likelihood of developing eczema and
               asthma but does not reduce development of food allergies. Most children eventually outgrow allergies
               to cow’s milk, egg, soy, and wheat. However, allergies to tree nuts, peanuts, and shellfish are more
               likely to be lifelong. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(2):​159-165. Copyright © 2023 American Academy of

   *—To minimize a delay in peanut introduction for children who may test negative, testing for peanut serum IgE levels may be the preferred initial
   approach in certain health care settings. Food allergen panel testing or the addition of serum IgE testing for foods other than peanuts is not rec-
   ommended due to poor positive predictive value. A1
