            A 3,200-g infant was born at 37 weeks of ges-
            tation via repeat cesarean delivery to a woman                            FIGURE 1
            (gravida 5, para 5) presenting with spontaneous
            rupture of membranes. The infant appeared
            healthy with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at one and
            five minutes, respectively. No significant mater-
            nal history, prodromal symptoms, or abnormal
            examination findings were noted on admission.
            Regular prenatal care and testing were unremark-
            able. The parents denied a history of herpes sim-
            plex, but serology testing had not been performed.
            During establishment of breastfeeding in the first
            24 hours of life, several small (1 to 3 mm) lesions
            were discovered on the mucosal surface of the
            newborn’s lower lip.
               Eversion of the infant’s lower lip revealed non-
            friable, white papules with minimal erythema at
            the base, intermixed with lesions of more vesicu-
            lar appearance. No significant pain or discomfort
            was elicited on palpation. Mucoid, white material
            could be expressed when scraping pressure was
            applied to an isolated lesion. The newborn’s phys-                   Question

            and his vital signs were within normal limits.                       examination findings, which one of the follow-
