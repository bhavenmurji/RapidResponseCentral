                               Prenatal Care:​
                        An Evidence-Based Approach
                      Sarah Inés Ramírez, MD, FAAFP, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania



  Well-coordinated prenatal care that follows an evidence-based, informed process results in fewer hospital admissions,
  improved education, greater satisfaction, and lower pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality. Care initiated at 10 weeks
  or earlier improves outcomes. Identification and treatment of periodontal disease decreases preterm delivery risk. A prepreg-
  nancy body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2 is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, miscarriage,
  and stillbirth. Advanced maternal and paternal age (35 years or older) is associated with gestational diabetes, hyperten-
  sion, miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, aneuploidy, birth defects, and
  stillbirth. Rho(D) immune globulin decreases alloimmunization risk in a patient
  who is RhD-negative carrying a fetus who is RhD-positive. Treatment of iron
  deficiency anemia decreases the risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth
  restriction, and perinatal depression. Ancestry-based genetic risk stratification
  using family history can inform genetic screening. Folic acid supplementation
  (400 to 800 mcg daily) decreases the risk of neural tube defects. All pregnant
  patients should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria, sexually transmitted
  infections, and immunity against rubella and varicella and should receive teta-
  nus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), influenza,
  and COVID-19 vaccines. Testing for group B Streptococcus should be performed
  between 36 and 37 weeks, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be initi-




                                                                                                                                                                   Illustration by Jonathan Dimes
  ated to decrease the risk of neonatal infection. Because of the impact of social determinants of health on outcomes, universal
  screening for depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, substance use, and food insecurity is recommended early in
  pregnancy. Screening for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks is recommended for all patients. People at risk of
  preeclampsia, including those diagnosed with COVID-19 in pregnancy, should be offered 81 mg of aspirin daily starting at
  12 weeks. Chronic hypertension should be treated to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​
