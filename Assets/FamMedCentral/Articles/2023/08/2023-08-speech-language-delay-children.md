               Childhood speech and language concerns are commonly encountered in the primary care setting.
               Family physicians are integral in the identification and initial evaluation of children with speech and
               language delays. Parental concerns and observations and milestone assessment aid in the identifica-
               tion of speech and language abnormalities. Concerning presentations at 24 months or older include
               speaking fewer than 50 words, incomprehensible speech, and notable speech and language deficits
               on age-specific testing. Validated screening tools that rely on parental reporting can serve as practical
               adjuncts during clinic evaluation. Early referral for additional evaluation can mitigate the development
               of long-term communication disorders and adverse effects on social and academic development. All
               children who have concerns for speech and language delays should be referred to speech language
               pathology and audiology for diagnostic and management purposes. Parents and caretakers may also
               self-refer to early intervention programs for evaluation and management of speech and language con-
               cerns in children younger than three years. (Am Fam Physician. 2023;​108(2):181-188. Copyright © 2023
