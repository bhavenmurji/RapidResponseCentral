   From Your Family Doctor




                                     Food Allergies (continued)
Is there a treatment for food allergy?
                                                           Notes from your family doctor
There is no cure for food allergies. Some medicines
may help if you have a mild reaction. To prevent
future allergic reactions, do not eat the food that is
causing the problem. You can lower your chance of
an allergic reaction by doing these things:
    • Your doctor may tell you to start your baby
between four and six months of age on foods that can
cause allergies. This can decrease the chance of your
child getting food allergies.
    • Read food labels carefully. Check the ingredient
list for any foods that may cause allergies. Look for
phrases like “This product may contain trace amounts
of (food),” or “This product is made at a facility that
uses (food).” Bring the food labels to your doctor’s
office so you can ask any questions.
    • When you eat at a restaurant, ask what is in your
food if you are not sure.
    • Be aware of foods that can cause allergy
symptoms. For example, if you are allergic to shrimp,
eating lobster or crab also may cause symptoms.
    • Wash your hands after touching any food to
which you or anyone in your family is allergic.
    • Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that
says what foods you are allergic to if you have a severe
reaction.
    • Carry an epinephrine (EP-uh-NEF-rin) shot with
you if you have a severe allergic reaction. Your doctor
or pharmacist can show you how to use it. You can
also learn how to use an epinephrine pen by watching
the video at https://www.epipen.com/about-epipen-
and-generic/how-to-use-epipen.
