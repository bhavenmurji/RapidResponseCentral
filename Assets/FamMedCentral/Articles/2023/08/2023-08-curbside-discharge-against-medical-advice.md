   Approach to patients who want to be discharged against medical advice.
   *—Attempt to treat substance use withdrawal and pain, communicate in a compassionate and nonjudgmental manner, provide proactive treat-
   ment of physical and emotional symptoms, and offer behavioral health consultation.
   †—The following are reversible causes that should be considered when determining decision-making capacity:​acute intoxication, acute psy-
   chiatric illness, homicidal or suicidal ideation, known cognitive disability, and medical conditions causing cognitive impairment;​in some cases,
   decision-making capacity is temporarily impaired (i.e., the patient is no longer intoxicated, mental health stabilized) and may require reassessment
   at a later time.
   ‡—Decision-making assessment:​Patient understands the relevant medical information, appreciates the medical situation and its consequences,
   exhibits logical reasoning of treatment options, and is able to express a choice.
   §—Consider behavioral health consultation, if needed, and perform validated cognitive examination (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE],
   Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], Saint Louis University Mental Status [SLUMS] examination).
   ||—If the patient or the surrogate decision maker refuses to sign the discharge against medical advice form, have a nurse and another licensed
   professional document the patient’s or surrogate decision maker’s refusal to sign.
