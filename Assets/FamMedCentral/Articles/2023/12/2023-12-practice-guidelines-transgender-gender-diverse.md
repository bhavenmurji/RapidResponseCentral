   GLOSSARY OF EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE AND STATISTICAL TERMS

   Term                     Definition

   Sensitivity             Percentage of patients with disease who have a positive test for the disease in question
   Specificity             Percentage of patients without disease who have a negative test for the disease in question
   Predictive value        Percentage of patients with a positive or negative test for a disease who do or do not have the disease
   (positive [PV+] and     in question
   negative [PV–])
   Pretest probability     Probability of disease before a test is performed
   Post-test probability   Probability of disease after a test is performed
   Likelihood ratio (LR)   LR > 1 indicates an increased likelihood of disease, LR < 1 indicates a decreased likelihood of disease.
                           The most helpful tests generally have a ratio of less than 0.2 or greater than 5.
   Relative risk reduc-    The percentage difference in risk or outcomes between treatment and control groups. Example: if
   tion (RRR)              mortality is 30% in controls and 20% with treatment, RRR is (30 – 20)/30 = 33%.
   Absolute risk reduc-    The arithmetic difference in risk or outcomes between treatment and control groups. Example: if
   tion (ARR)              mortality is 30% in controls and 20% with treatment, ARR is 30 – 20 = 10%.
   Number needed to        The number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the alternative in order for one
   treat (NNT)             additional patient to benefit. The NNT is calculated as: 1/ARR. Example: if the ARR is 4%, the NNT =
                           1/4% = 1/0.04 = 25.
   Number needed to        The number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the alternative in order for one
   harm (NNH)              additional patient to experience an adverse event.
   95% CI                  An estimate of certainty. It is 95% certain that the true value lies within the given range. A narrow CI is
                           good. A CI that spans 1.0 calls into question the validity of the result.
   Systematic review       A type of review article that uses explicit methods to comprehensively analyze and qualitatively syn-
                           thesize information from multiple studies
   Meta-analysis           A type of systematic review that uses rigorous statistical methods to quantitatively synthesize the
                           results of multiple similar studies
