   PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS TO PREVENT ACQUISITION OF HIV:​CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE
   USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

   What does the USPSTF          Adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) at increased risk* of HIV acquisition:​
   recommend?                    Prescribe PrEP with effective antiretroviral therapy* to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV.
                                 Grade:​ A
                                 *—See the “How to implement this recommendation” section for more information on identifying
                                 persons at increased risk and for information on effective antiretroviral therapy for PrEP.

   To whom does the rec-         This recommendation applies to adolescents and adults who do not have HIV and are at increased
   ommendation apply?            risk of HIV.

   What’s new?                   This recommendation is consistent with the 2019 USPSTF recommendation on PrEP for the pre-
                                 vention of HIV.
                                 For the current recommendation, the USPSTF reviewed additional evidence on new formulations
                                 of PrEP (tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine [TAF/FTC] and cabotegravir).

   How to implement this         Routinely take a sexual and injection drug use history for all patients.
   recommendation?               Inform all adolescents and adults who are sexually active or who inject drugs that there are ways
                                 to help prevent acquisition of HIV.
                                 The USPSTF recommends that the following persons be considered for HIV PrEP:​
                                 Sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who have engaged in anal or
                                 vaginal sex in the past six months and have any of the following:​
                                   A sexual partner who has HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load).
                                   A bacterial sexually transmitted infection (syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia for men who have
                                   sex with men and transgender women;​gonorrhea and syphilis for heterosexual women and
                                   men) in the past six months.
                                   A history of inconsistent or no condom use with sex partner(s) whose HIV status is not known;​
                                   assessing risk in conversation with the patient and considering factors such as number of partners,
                                   the specific sexual activities a person engages in, and whether their sex partner or partners are in a
                                   group with a higher prevalence of HIV (e.g., men who have sex with men or with men and women,
                                   transgender women, persons who inject drugs, and persons who engage in transactional sex).
                                                                                                                                       continues

   PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS TO PREVENT ACQUISITION OF HIV:​CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE
   USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)

   recommendation?               equipment.
                                 Transgender women are at especially high risk of HIV acquisition and should be considered for
                                 PrEP based on the criteria outlined above.
                                 Persons who engage in transactional sex, such as sex for money, drugs, or housing, including
                                 commercial sex workers or persons trafficked for sex work, constitute a group at increased risk of
                                 HIV acquisition and should be considered for PrEP based on the criteria outlined above.
                                 Persons who request PrEP may have undisclosed behaviors that put them at risk.
                                 Effective formulations of PrEP with current FDA approval include:​
                                   Oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) and injectable cabotegravir are
                                   approved for use in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) to reduce the
                                   risk of sexually acquired HIV.
                                   Oral TAF/FTC is approved for use in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb)
                                   to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex.
                                   No PrEP medications have FDA approval for the indication of reducing the risk of acquiring HIV
                                   via injection drug use, but CDC guidelines note that persons who inject drugs are likely to bene-
                                   fit from PrEP with any FDA-approved PrEP medication.
                                 It is important that persons taking PrEP receive counseling about medication adherence and safer
                                 sex including condom use, regular testing for HIV, and other necessary testing.
