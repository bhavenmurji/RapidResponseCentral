   SCREENING AND PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR ORAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN AND

   What does the USPSTF          For asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years:​
   recommend?                    The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening per-
                                 formed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries.

   What’s new?                   This is a new USPSTF recommendation.

   How to implement this         The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening or preven-
   recommendation?               tive interventions for oral health conditions in the primary care setting for children and adolescents.
                                 The USPSTF is calling for more research on addressing oral health in nondental primary care set-
                                 tings, particularly in persons who are more likely to experience oral health conditions and on social
                                 factors that contribute to disparities in oral health.
                                 In the absence of evidence, primary care clinicians should use their clinical expertise to decide
                                 whether to perform these services.

                                 Dental caries refers to a multifactorial disease process resulting in demineralization of the teeth.
                                 The evidence review focused on dental caries as the most common oral health condition and the
                                 most potentially amenable to primary care interventions.
                                                                                                                                       continues

   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   SCREENING AND PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR ORAL HEALTH IN CHILDREN AND
   ADOLESCENTS AGED 5 TO 17 YEARS:​CLINICIAN SUMMARY OF USPSTF RECOMMENDATION
   (continued)


   Why are this recom-           Dental caries is a common chronic condition of childhood;​in 2011 in the U.S., more than 50% of
   mendation and topic           children aged 6 to 11 years had dental caries in primary teeth and 17% had caries in permanent teeth.
   important?                    Developmental defects in teeth, inadequate salivary composition or flow, frequent intake of dietary
                                 sugars (in foods and beverages), suboptimal fluoride exposure, and oral hygiene practices (e.g., lack
                                 of tooth brushing and flossing) can increase susceptibility to dental caries.
                                 In the U.S., oral health disparities are shaped by unequally affordable and accessible dental care and
                                 other disadvantages related to social determinants of health (e.g., living in a rural area or immigra-
                                 tion status).
                                 Dental caries disproportionately affects persons living in poverty;​Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino,
                                 Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander children and adolescents;​chil-
