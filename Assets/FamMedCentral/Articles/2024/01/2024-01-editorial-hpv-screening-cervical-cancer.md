     Patients 30 to 65 years of age with a cervix and a high-risk condition (i.e., solid organ transplanta-
     tion, chronic diseases managed by Janus kinase inhibitors or biologics, immunosuppressive drug
     treatment, HIV/AIDS, postcoital bleeding, or under surveillance for prior HPV-positive testing per
     American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines)

   HPV = human papillomavirus.
   *—High risk is not defined by smoking status, drug use, number of sex partners, or age (Demarco M, Egemen D, Hyun N, et al. Contribution of etio-
   logic cofactors to CIN3+ risk among women with human papillomavirus-positive screening test results. J Low Genit Tract Dis. 2022;26(2):127-134).
