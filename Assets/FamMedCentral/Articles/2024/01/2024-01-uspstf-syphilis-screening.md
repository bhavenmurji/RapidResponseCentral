                   U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
             Screening for Syphilis Infection
         in Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults
   SCREENING FOR SYPHILIS INFECTION IN NONPREGNANT ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS:​CLINICAL
   SUMMARY OF USPSTF RECOMMENDATION
   What does the USPSTF rec-            Screen for syphilis in persons at increased risk for infection.
   ommend?                              Grade:​ A

   To whom does the recom-              Adolescents and adults who have ever been sexually active and are at increased risk for syph-
   mendation apply?                     ilis infection.
                                        It does not apply to pregnant persons, who are discussed in a separate recommendation
                                        statement.
                                        It does not apply to persons who have signs or symptoms of syphilis.

   What’s new?                         This recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. The USPSTF
                                       continues to recommend screening for syphilis in nonpregnant persons who are at increased
                                       risk for infection.

   How to implement this rec-           Assess risk:​
   ommendation?                        • Risk of syphilis is higher in men who have sex with men;​persons with HIV infection or other
                                          sexually transmitted infections;​persons who use illicit drugs;​and persons with a history of
                                          incarceration, sex work, or military service.
                                       • However, clinicians should be aware of how common syphilis infection is in their communi-
                                          ty and assess patient’s individual risk.
                                        Screen and confirm:​Options for testing include:​
                                       • Traditional screening algorithm:​Screen with an initial nontreponemal test (e.g., Venereal Dis-
                                          ease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test). If positive, confirm with
                                          a treponemal antibody detection test (e.g., T. pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA] test).
                                       • Reverse sequence algorithm:​Screen with an initial automated treponemal test (e.g.,
                                          enzyme-linked or chemiluminescence immunoassay). If positive, confirm with a nontrepo-
                                          nemal test.
                                        Screening interval:​
                                       • Although evidence on optimal screening intervals is limited for the general population, men
                                          who have sex with men or persons with HIV infection may benefit from screening at least
                                          annually or more frequently (e.g., every 3 to 6 months) if they continue to be at high risk.
                                                                                                                                       continues

   SCREENING FOR SYPHILIS INFECTION IN NONPREGNANT ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS:​CLINICAL
   SUMMARY OF USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)
   What additional informa-             Primary and secondary syphilis rates are higher in Black, Hispanic, Native American/Alaska
   tion should clinicians know          Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander persons. These disparities are primarily driven by
   about this recommendation?           social determinants of health such as differences in income level, education level, and access
                                        to coverage and care, which make it harder to maintain sexual health.
                                        Differences in sexual network characteristics also play a role in disparities. Sexually active
                                        people may be more likely to become infected in communities with higher sexually transmit-
                                        ted infection rates.

   Why are this recommenda-             After reaching a record low in 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing over the past 20
   tion and topic important?            years.
                                        Without treatment, syphilis can damage the brain, nerves, eyes, and cardiovascular system.
                                        Screening and follow-up treatment can cure syphilis and prevent complications.
