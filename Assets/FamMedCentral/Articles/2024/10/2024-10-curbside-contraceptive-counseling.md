                               Some methods involve taking a pill, getting a shot, applying a patch on your skin, inserting a vaginal
                               ring, timing ovulation, using a barrier, or placing protection under the skin of your arm or in your
                               uterus. Do you have preferences or questions about any of these options?

                               Great, I’ll avoid talking about methods that you cannot switch quickly.

                               I appreciate your telling me that you want a method that is easy to remember using.

  Reflective listening         Thank you for sharing your thoughts about that method and trusting me with that information.

                               That’s good to hear. It helps me to provide you with some extra details you may be interested in to

                               Thanks for telling me you have already picked a method. Do you have any questions about this or
                               other methods? I just want to make sure you know all the options.

  Responding to con-           Absolutely! A lot of people feel more comfortable when they have a regular period. Let’s talk about

                               It’s unfortunate that your friend had mood changes and weight gain when they used that method.
                               This can happen, but it is unlikely overall. If you choose that method, we can quickly make a change

  Birth Control Methods Chart
  Designed for providers to help clients consider their birth control options, this chart takes client autonomy into account and presents methods that clients can start and stop on their
  own and those that require provider involvement (prescription or procedure). The chart highlights method characteristics, including use & frequency, so clients can make informed
  decisions, based on their own preferences. Note: Within each table, the methods are listed in order of pregnancy risk, and side effects are alphabetized within each method.
