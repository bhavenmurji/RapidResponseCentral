# gender affirming surgery

                      Lifelong Care of Patients After
                        Gender-Affirming Surgery

  Gender-affirming surgery includes a range of procedures that help align a transgender or gender diverse person’s body with
  their gender identity. As rates of gender-affirming surgery increase, family physicians will need to have the knowledge and
  skills to provide lifelong health care to this population. Physicians should conduct an anatomic survey or organ inventory
  with patients to determine what health screenings are applicable. Health care maintenance should follow accepted guide-
  lines for the body parts that are present. Patients do not require routine breast cancer screening after mastectomy;​however,
  because there is residual breast tissue, symptoms of breast cancer warrant workup. After masculinizing genital surgery,
  patients should have lifelong follow-up with a urologist familiar with gender-affirming surgery. If a prostate examination
  is indicated after vaginoplasty, it should be performed vaginally. If a pelvic examination is indicated after vaginoplasty, it
  should be performed with a Pederson speculum or anoscope. After gonadectomy, patients require hormone therapy to pre-
  vent long-term morbidity associated with hypogonadism, including osteoporosis. The risk of sexually transmitted infections
  may change after genital surgery depending on the tissue used for the procedure. Patients should be offered the same testing
  and treatment for sexually transmitted infections as cisgender populations, with site-specific testing based on sexual history.
  If bowel tissue is used in vaginoplasty, vaginal bleeding may be caused by adenocarcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease.
