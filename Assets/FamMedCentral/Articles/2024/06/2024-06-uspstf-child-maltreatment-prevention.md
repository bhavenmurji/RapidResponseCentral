   PRIMARY CARE INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT CHILD MALTREATMENT:​CLINICAL SUMMARY
   OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

   What does the         For children and adolescents younger than 18 years without signs and symptoms of or known exposure
   USPSTF recom-         to maltreatment:​
   mend?                The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions to
                        prevent child maltreatment.
                         Grade:​I statement

   To whom does         This recommendation applies to children and adolescents younger than 18 years who do not have signs or
   the recommen-        symptoms of or known exposure to maltreatment.
   dation apply?

   What’s new?          This recommendation is consistent with the previous 2018 recommendation statement.

   How to im-            After careful review of the evidence, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
   plement this          primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment.
   recommenda-          This recommendation does not apply to children or adolescents with signs or symptoms of maltreatment.
   tion?                Children with signs or symptoms suggestive of maltreatment should be assessed and reported according to
                        the applicable state laws.
                         Multiple interventions to prevent child maltreatment have been studied, including primary care programs
                         designed to identify youth at increased risk for maltreatment who may benefit from parent education, refer-
                         ral to community resources, approaches to increase the use of positive discipline strategies, and psycho-
                         therapy to improve caregivers’ coping skills and strategies to strengthen the parent-child relationship.
                         Clinicians should use their clinical judgment when deciding whether and when to provide interventions to
                         help prevent child maltreatment in children without signs or symptoms.
                                                                                                                                        continues

   Note:​ The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence
   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   PRIMARY CARE INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT CHILD MALTREATMENT:​CLINICAL SUMMARY
   OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)

   What addi-            Although the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of preventing maltreat-
   tional infor-         ment among children without signs or symptoms of maltreatment, this recommendation does not assess
   mation should         the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., home visitation programs) for other outcomes (e.g., improving child
   clinicians know       and family well-being).
   about this rec-       Child maltreatment refers to any action, series of actions, or lack of action resulting in harm, potential harm,
   ommendation?          or threat of harm to children and adolescents younger than 18 years.
                         Child maltreatment may refer to abuse or neglect by a parent, caregiver, or anyone in the context of a “rela-
                         tionship of responsibility, trust, or power.”
                         For this recommendation statement, child abuse includes, but is not limited to, physical abuse, sexual abuse,
                         and psychological or emotional abuse.

   Why are this          Child maltreatment, which includes child abuse and neglect, can have profound effects on health, develop-
   recommenda-           ment, survival, and well-being throughout childhood and adulthood.
   tion and topic        In 2021, an estimated 600,000 children were identified by Child Protective Services as having experienced
   important?            abuse or neglect, and an estimated 1,820 children died of abuse and neglect.
                         Child maltreatment affects children of all ages and racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
                         Given pervasive racial and ethnic disparities in child maltreatment reporting, investigation, and placement in
                         the child welfare system, biases in identification of child maltreatment may disproportionately disadvantage
                         Black, Hispanic, and Native American/Alaska Native families.

   What are             The USPSTF has a recommendation statement on screening for intimate partner violence and abuse of
   other relevant       older and vulnerable adults.

   What are addi-       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s report “Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect:​A Technical
   tional tools and     Package for Policy, Norm, and Programmatic Activities” offers a group of strategies based on best available
   resources?           evidence to assist in prevention of child abuse and neglect (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/

                        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offers “Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Preven-
                        tion Resource for Action:​A Compilation of the Best Available Evidence,” a report on the best evidence to
                        prevent adverse childhood experiences (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ACEs-Prevention-
                        Resource_508.pdf).
                        The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed a “Prevention Resource Guide” to sup-
                        port and promote family well-being and prevention of child maltreatment (https://​www.childwelfare.gov/
                        resources/20232024-prevention-resource-guide). The Department also offers publications and additional
                        resources that could be helpful to primary care clinicians (https://​www.childwelfare.gov).
