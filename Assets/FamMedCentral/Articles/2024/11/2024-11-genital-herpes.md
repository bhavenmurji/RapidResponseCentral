Genital Herpes:​Rapid Evidence Review
Meghan Plunkett, MD;​Colby T. Neville, DO;​and Jennifer G. Chang, MD



   Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least
   500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable
   viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended
   in asymptomatic individuals. Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral ther-
   apy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and use of condoms. A clinically apparent
   herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a
   flulike syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral
   culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing. Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and
   are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, men-
   ingitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation
   in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active
   lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.
