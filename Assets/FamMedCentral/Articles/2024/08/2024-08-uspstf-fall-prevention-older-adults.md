  INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT FALLS IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS:​
  CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

  What does the                 Community-dwelling adults 65 years or older:​
  USPSTF recommend?             The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65
                                years or older who are at increased risk for falls.

                                B grade

                                The USPSTF recommends that clinicians individualize the decision to offer multifactorial interven-
                                tions to prevent falls to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls.

                                C grade

  To whom does the rec-         These recommendations apply to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased
  ommendation apply?            risk of falls.

  What’s new?                   In 2018, the USPSTF recommendation statement on falls prevention included a recommendation
                                against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.
                                The current recommendation does not address the use of vitamin D to prevent falls;​this evidence
                                will be reviewed in a separate USPSTF recommendation.

                                This recommendation is otherwise consistent with the 2018 USPSTF recommendation.

  How to implement              Determine who is at increased risk for falls:​
  this recommendation?           • Increasing age is strongly related to risk for falls.

                                 • Intervention studies most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk.

                                 • A pragmatic approach to identifying persons at increased risk for falls would be to assess for a
                                 history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility.

                                Refer older adults at increased risk for falls to exercise interventions.

                                Individualize the decision to refer older adults at increased risk for falls to multifactorial interventions.
                                 • When determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians
                                 should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, pres-
                                 ence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient’s values and preferences.
                                                                                                                                   continues ➤

  Note:​ The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence
  but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

  CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)

  What additional              The most common components of exercise interventions were gait, balance, and functional train-
  information should           ing, followed by strength and resistance training, flexibility, and endurance training.
  clinicians know about        Multifactorial interventions include an initial assessment of modifiable risk factors for falls (e.g.,
  this recommendation?         balance, gait, vision, postural blood pressure, medication, environment, cognition, and psycholog-
                               ical health) and subsequent customized interventions for each patient based on issues identified in

  Why are this recom-          Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the United
  mendation and topic          States. In 2018, 27.5% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported at least one fall in the
  important?                   past year, and 10.2% reported a fall-related injury. In 2021, 38,742 deaths resulted from fall-related
                               injuries.

  What are other               The USPSTF has issued recommendations on screening for osteoporosis and on the use of calcium
