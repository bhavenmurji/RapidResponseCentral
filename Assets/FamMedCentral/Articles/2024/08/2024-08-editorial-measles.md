Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, there
were an estimated 3 million to 4 million cases of measles each
year, leading to 48,000 hospitalizations, 1,000 cases of enceph-
alitis, and 400 to 500 deaths.5
   The incubation period for measles is typically 10 to 12 days
but can be as long as 21 days. Illness starts with a high fever
and the 3 Cs: cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. After about
4 days, an erythematous, maculopapular rash appears on the
face and spreads downward to cover the body. This rash lasts
about 6 days. Koplik spots (tiny white spots inside the mouth)
may also appear 2 or 3 days after the first symptoms (Figure 16).
A person with measles is infectious 4 days before through 4
days after the appearance of the rash.
