   SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

   What does the USPSTF               For asymptomatic adults 18 years or older:​
   recommend?                         The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening
                                      performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or
                                      periodontal-related disease.

   What’s new?                        This is a new USPSTF recommendation.

   How to implement this              The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening or
   recommendation?                    preventive interventions for oral health conditions in the primary care setting for adults.
                                      The USPSTF is calling for more research on addressing oral health in nondental primary care
                                      settings, particularly in persons who are more likely to experience oral health conditions and
                                      on social factors that contribute to disparities in oral health.
                                      In the absence of evidence, primary care clinicians should use their clinical expertise to decide
                                      whether to perform these services.
                                                                                                                                       continues

   Note:​The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence
   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION (continued)
   What additional informa-           The USPSTF has a separate existing recommendation for children younger than 5 years that
   tion should clinicians know        recommends prescribing oral fluoride supplements starting at age 6 months for children
   about this recommenda-             younger than 5 years whose water supply is deficient in fluoride and applying varnish to the

                                      Dental caries refers to a multifactorial disease process resulting in demineralization of the teeth.
                                      Periodontal disease refers to inflammation of the gingival tissue, or gingivitis, which affects the
                                      hard and soft tissue that support the teeth and can progress to periodontitis involving bone loss.
                                      The evidence review focused on dental caries and periodontitis as the most common oral
                                      health conditions and the most potentially amenable to primary care interventions.

   Why are this recommenda-           Dental caries is the most common condition in adults worldwide;​more than 90% of U.S. adults
   tion and topic important?          are affected by dental caries, and an estimated 26% have untreated dental caries.
                                      Untreated dental caries can lead to serious infections and tooth loss.
                                      Untreated periodontitis can contribute to destruction of tissues that support the teeth and is
                                      the leading cause of tooth loss in older adults.
                                      In the U.S., oral health disparities are shaped by unequally affordable and accessible dental care
                                      and other disadvantages related to social determinants of health (e.g., living in a rural area).
                                      Dental caries and periodontitis disproportionately affect persons living in poverty;​Asian, Black,
                                      Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adults;​
                                      pregnant persons;​adults with disabilities;​older adults;​adults living in rural and urban un-
                                      derserved areas;​adults without insurance or with public insurance;​and adults experiencing
                                      homelessness.
