  SCREENING FOR ANXIETY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS:
  CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

  What does the USPSTF           Children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years:
  recommend?                     Screen for anxiety.

                                 Grade: B

                                 Children 7 years or younger:

                                 The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for anxiety.

                                 I statement

  To whom does the               This recommendation applies to children and adolescents 18 years or younger who do not have a
  recommendation apply?          diagnosed anxiety disorder and who are not showing recognized signs or symptoms of anxiety.

  What’s new?                    This is a new USPSTF recommendation.

  How to implement this          There are multiple treatment options available, including medications, counseling, a combination
  recommendation?                of these approaches, and collaborative care, which is a team approach where the primary care
                                 clinician works with a behavioral health care manager and psychiatrist to ensure patients receive
                                 the best care.

                                 Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors, signs, and symptoms of anxiety, listen to any patient
                                 concerns, and make sure that persons who need help get it. Youth diagnosed with anxiety and
                                 their health care professional should decide together with the parents or guardians what treat-
                                 ment is right for them.


  What additional                Although all youth aged 8 to 18 years are at risk for anxiety and should be screened, there are
  information should             factors that increase the risk. Risk factors for anxiety disorders include genetic, personality, and
  clinicians know about          environmental factors, such as attachment difficulties, conflict between parents, parental over-

                                 risk, including LGBTQ youth, transgender youth, and older adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

                                 In the absence of evidence, health care professionals should use their judgement based on indi-
                                 vidual patient circumstances when determining whether to screen for anxiety in youth 7 years or
                                 younger.
