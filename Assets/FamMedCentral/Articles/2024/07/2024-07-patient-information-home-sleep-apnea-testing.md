are more likely to stay in the hospital.4-6 Treating sleep
apnea in patients with cardiovascular disease is good,                      Notes from your family doctor:
particularly in people with symptoms of sleepiness.
However, it is unclear which groups of patients with
cardiovascular disease benefit the most from treatment.7
Cardiovascular conditions that may benefit from treat-
ment are shown in Table 1.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I DO MY HOME
SLEEP TEST?
Your doctor reviews the data collected from the home
sleep apnea test and makes a treatment plan based on
your health history. Staying at a healthy weight and
being active are important for treating sleep apnea.8
By taking your prescribed medicines, controlling your
weight, getting aerobic exercise, and doing your best to
follow your sleep apnea treatment plan, you can take
care of your heart so that it can take care of you.
