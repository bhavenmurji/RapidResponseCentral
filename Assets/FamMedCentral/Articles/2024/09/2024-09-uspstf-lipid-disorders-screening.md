Screening for Lipid Disorders in Children and Adolescents

  SCREENING FOR LIPID DISORDERS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS:​
  CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

  What does the                For children and adolescents 20 years or younger:​
  USPSTF recommend?            The USPSTF found that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and
                               harms of screening for lipid disorders.

  To whom does the rec-        This recommendation statement applies to children and adolescents who do not have signs or
  ommendation apply?           symptoms of a lipid disorder.

  What’s new?                  This recommendation statement is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation.

  How to implement             There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for lipid disorders in children
  this recommendation?         and adolescents. The USPSTF is calling for more long-term data on the effectiveness of screening
                               for and treatment of lipid disorders in the general pediatric population to prevent premature car-
                               diovascular events or death in adulthood.

                               In the absence of evidence, clinicians are encouraged to use their judgment when deciding whether
                               to screen for lipid disorders in children and adolescents.

  What additional              There are 2 main types of lipid disorders seen in children and adolescents:​familial hypercholester-

  clinicians know about        causes very high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol early in life. Multifactorial dyslipid-
  this recommendation?         emia is much more common than FH and is primarily associated with environmental factors such as
                               excessive intake of saturated fat, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity.

                               The evidence review for FH focused on heterozygous FH, because it is the most common type of FH.
                               Dyslipidemia due to homozygous FH or secondary causes (such as diabetes, nephrotic syndrome,
                               or hypothyroidism), and targeted screening based on family history of premature cardiovascular
                               events, are outside the scope of this review.
                                                                                                                                  continues ➤

  but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.
