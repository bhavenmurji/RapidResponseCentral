Inside AFP


AFP’s Article of the Year
Sumi Sexton, MD




T     his is the second year we are presenting the “American
      Family Physician Article of the Year Award,” which is
selected based on the most online views and highest ratings
from the AFP editors. From 1986 to 2001, AFP presented the
Walter Kemp Award annually, and we are pleased to bring back
the practice of honoring authors for their excellent scholarly
contributions to family medicine.
   The 2023 AFP Article of the Year award goes to Drs. Andrew
J. Goodbred and Robert C. Langan for their article “Chronic
Kidney Disease:​Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment” which
was published in the December 2023 issue and is available
at https://​w ww.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2023/1200/chronic-
kidney-disease.html. Because chronic kidney disease affects
roughly 15% of the U.S. population with a steadily increasing
disease burden globally, this article provides key updates for
patient care. It includes screening recommendations;​using the
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creati-
nine equation without the race variable to calculate eGFR with
confirmatory measuring of serum cystatin C;​managing comor-
bidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and
bone mineral disorders;​and referral indications.
   The 2023 award will be presented this month at the Con-               Andrew J. Goodbred
gress of Delegates Award Luncheon at the FMX Conference
in Phoenix, Ariz.
