The percentage of U.S. residents 65
years and older was 17% in 2020, and                       FIGURE 1
this number is expected to rise due
to the aging of the baby boomer gen-
eration.1 Although life expectancy
fell between 2020 and 2021, the pro-
portion of U.S. residents older than
65 years continues to increase.2 This
age group often has more medical
comorbidities and prescription med-
ications, increasing the demand for
primary care access. Domestic migra-
tion (U.S. residents moving within the
country) of this retirement-aged pop-
ulation further strains the primary
care workforce in underserved areas.

Domestic migration increased during
the COVID-19 pandemic and in the                                                                        High-growth and low-capacity counties
