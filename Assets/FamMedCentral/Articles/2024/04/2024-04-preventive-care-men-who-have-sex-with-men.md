                        Preventive Care for Men Who

                Men who have sex with men (MSM) is an inclusive term used to refer to phenotypic males who have
                insertive or receptive sex (penile-anal or penile-oral) with other phenotypic males, including people
                who are transgender or have other gender identities. MSM may report their sexual orientation as homo-
                sexual, bisexual, heterosexual, or something else, but this stated sexual orientation may not align with
                their sexual attraction or behaviors. Several health conditions disproportionately affect MSM compared
                with age-matched heterosexual men, including HIV infection, anal cancer, syphilis, and depression.
                Clinicians should use culturally sensitive questions to obtain a comprehensive sexual history and assess
                sexual risk. MSM should receive regular screening for HIV, hepatitis B and C, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and
                syphilis. Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B and human papillomavirus should be offered. MSM may ben-
                efit from preexposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection, postexposure prophylaxis to reduce the
                risk of HIV transmission, and counseling on safer sexual practices. Screening for anal cancer associated
                with human papillomavirus may be performed by digital anal rectal examination, although the optimal
                screening strategy has yet to be determined. Clinicians should also consider more frequent screenings
                for mental health issues in the MSM population because the rates of depression, suicide, substance
                use, and other psychosocial issues are higher than those of the general population. (Am Fam Physician.
