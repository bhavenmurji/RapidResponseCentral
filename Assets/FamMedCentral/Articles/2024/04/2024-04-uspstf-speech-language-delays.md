   SCREENING FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE DELAY AND DISORDERS IN
   CHILDREN:​CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

   What does the USPSTF rec-          Children five years or younger without signs or symptoms of speech and language delay and
   ommend?                            disorders:​
                                      The USPSTF found that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and
                                      harms of screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children.
                                      Grade:​I statement

   To whom does the recom-            This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children five years or younger whose parents or clini-
   mendation apply?                   cians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development.
                                      This recommendation does not apply to children with another condition that may cause speech or
                                      language impairment (e.g., autism spectrum disorder).

   What’s new?                        This updated recommendation is consistent with the 2015 USPSTF recommendation on screening for
                                      speech and language delay and disorders in children five years or younger.

   How to implement this rec-         There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for speech and language delay
   ommendation?                       and disorders in younger children. The USPSTF is calling for more research on the benefits and harms
                                      of screening for speech and language delays and disorders, especially in populations known to have
                                      the highest burden (Black and Hispanic/Latino children and children from households with low
                                      incomes).
                                      Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether and how to screen for speech and
                                      language delay and disorders. Clinicians should also be aware of signs and symptoms of speech and
                                      language delays and disorders and listen to any caregiver concerns.

   What additional information        The estimated prevalence of speech and language disorders ranges between 3% and 16% of U.S. chil-
   should clinicians know about       dren and adolescents aged 3 to 21 years. Boys are more than twice as likely to be affected than girls.
   this recommendation?               There are notable disparities in the prevalence of speech and language delays and disorders, with
                                      Black and Hispanic/Latino children and children from households with low incomes having higher
                                      rates of speech and language delays and disorders compared with White children.
                                      The USPSTF found adequate evidence on the accuracy of screening tools to detect speech and lan-
                                      guage delay and disorders. However, there was limited and inconsistent evidence on the effective-
                                      ness of interventions on intermediate outcomes such as speech and language domains (e.g., fluency,
                                      articulation, and expressive and receptive language) and health outcomes (e.g., improved school
                                      performance, social/emotional function, or quality of life).
                                                                                                                                        continues

   Note:​ The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence
   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   Why are this recommenda-           Evidence suggests that many younger children identified with speech and language delay go on to
   tion and topic important?          recover without intervention.
                                      However, school-aged children with speech and language delays and disorders may be at increased
                                      risk of learning and literacy disabilities, including difficulties with reading and writing. Studies also
                                      suggest that children with these conditions may be at higher risk for social and behavioral problems
                                      in addition to learning problems, some of which may persist through adulthood.

   GLOSSARY OF EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE AND STATISTICAL TERMS

   Term                       Definition

   Sensitivity               Percentage of patients with disease who have a positive test for the disease in question
   Specificity               Percentage of patients without disease who have a negative test for the disease in question
   Predictive value          Percentage of patients with a positive or negative test for a disease who do or do not have the disease
   (positive [PV+] and       in question
   negative [PV–])
   Pretest probability       Probability of disease before a test is performed
   Post-test probability     Probability of disease after a test is performed
   Likelihood ratio (LR)     LR > 1 indicates an increased likelihood of disease, LR < 1 indicates a decreased likelihood of disease.
                             The most helpful tests generally have a ratio of less than 0.2 or greater than 5.
   Relative risk reduc-      The percentage difference in risk or outcomes between treatment and control groups. Example: if
   tion (RRR)                mortality is 30% in controls and 20% with treatment, RRR is (30 – 20)/30 = 33%.
   Absolute risk reduc-      The arithmetic difference in risk or outcomes between treatment and control groups. Example: if
   tion (ARR)                mortality is 30% in controls and 20% with treatment, ARR is 30 – 20 = 10%.
   Number needed to          The number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the alternative in order for one
   treat (NNT)               additional patient to benefit. The NNT is calculated as: 1/ARR. Example: if the ARR is 4%, the NNT =
                             1/4% = 1/0.04 = 25.
   Number needed to          The number of patients who need to receive an intervention instead of the alternative in order for one
   harm (NNH)                additional patient to experience an adverse event.
   95% CI                    An estimate of certainty. It is 95% certain that the true value lies within the given range. A narrow CI is
                             good. A CI that spans 1.0 calls into question the validity of the result.
   Systematic review         A type of review article that uses explicit methods to comprehensively analyze and qualitatively syn-
                             thesize information from multiple studies
   Meta-analysis             A type of systematic review that uses rigorous statistical methods to quantitatively synthesize the
                             results of multiple similar studies
