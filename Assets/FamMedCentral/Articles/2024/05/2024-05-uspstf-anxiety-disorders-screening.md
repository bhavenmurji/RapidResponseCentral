   SCREENING FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS IN ADULTS:​CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF
   RECOMMENDATION

   What does the                Adults 64 years or younger, including pregnant and postpartum persons:​Screen for anxiety.
   USPSTF recommend?            Grade:​ B
                                Older adults 65 years or older:​The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and
                                harms of screening for anxiety disorders.
                                Grade:​I statement

   To whom does the            This recommendation applies to adults (19 years or older), including pregnant and postpartum per-
   recommendation              sons, and older adults (65 years or older) who do not have a diagnosed mental health disorder and
   apply?                      are not showing recognized signs or symptoms of anxiety disorders.

   What’s new?                 This is a new USPSTF recommendation.

   How to implement            Treatment for anxiety disorders in adults can include psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Clinicians
   this recommenda-            should be aware of the risk factors, signs, and symptoms of anxiety, listen to any patient concerns,
   tion?                       and make sure that persons who need help get it.
                               To achieve the benefit of screening for anxiety disorders and reduce disparities in anxiety disorder–
                               associated morbidity, it is important that persons who screen positive are evaluated further for diag-
                               nosis and, if appropriate, are provided or referred for evidence-based care.
                                Clinicians are encouraged to consider the unique balance of benefits and harms in the perinatal peri-
                                od when deciding the best treatment for anxiety disorders for a pregnant or breastfeeding person.
                               The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for anxiety disorders. In the
                               absence of evidence, a pragmatic approach might include screening adults who have not been
                               screened previously and using clinical judgment while considering risk factors, comorbid conditions,
                               and life events to determine if additional screening of patients at increased risk is warranted. Ongoing
                               assessment of risks that may develop during pregnancy and the postpartum period is also a reason-
                               able approach.
                                                                                                                                       continues

   Note:​The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence
   but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation.

   clinicians know about       risk. These include family history of mental health conditions, presence of other mental health

                                In the absence of evidence, health care professionals should use their judgment based on individual
                                patient circumstances when determining whether to screen for anxiety disorders in adults 65 years
                                or older.
