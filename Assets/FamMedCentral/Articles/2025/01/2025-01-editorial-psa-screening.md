Kenneth W. Lin, MD, MPH




F    rom 2012 to 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force
     (USPSTF) recommended against performing prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening
                                                                         screening in primary care showed that most clinicians do not
