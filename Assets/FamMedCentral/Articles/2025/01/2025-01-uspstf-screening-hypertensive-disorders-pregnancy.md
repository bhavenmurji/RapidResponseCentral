Screening for Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy

  SCREENING FOR HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS OF PREGNANCY:​
  CLINICAL SUMMARY OF THE USPSTF RECOMMENDATION

  What does the                Pregnant persons:​
  USPSTF recommend?            Screen for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with blood pressure measurements throughout
                               pregnancy.

  To whom does the rec-        This recommendation applies to all pregnant women and pregnant persons of all genders without a
  ommendation apply?           known diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy or chronic hypertension.

  What’s new?                  This recommendation is consistent with the 2017 USPSTF recommendation statement on screening
                               for preeclampsia. The USPSTF broadened the scope of the updated review to screening for hyper-
                               tensive disorders of pregnancy.

  How to implement             Blood pressure measurements should be obtained during each prenatal care visit throughout preg-
  this recommendation?         nancy. If a patient has an elevated blood pressure reading, the reading should be confirmed with
                               repeated measurements.

                               To achieve the benefit of screening, it is important that persons who screen positive receive
                               evidence-based management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

  What additional              While it is known that risk continues into the immediate postpartum period, there is little evidence
