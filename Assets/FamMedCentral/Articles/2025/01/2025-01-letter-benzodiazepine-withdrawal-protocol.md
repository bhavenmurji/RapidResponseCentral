To the Editor:​The article about benzodiazepine use disorder               insights into the use of phenobarbital for acute detoxification
by Robertson, et al.1 did not mention the most effective way to            from benzodiazepines in hospitalized patients.3 On average,
wean patients from short-acting benzodiazepines. I successfully            these patients were administered phenobarbital, 220 mg daily,
have used a rapid taper of phenobarbital over 6 days. Pheno-               stayed in the hospital for 8 days, and underwent treatment
barbital has a duration of action of 80 to 120 hours vs 6 to 8             for 18 days. In addition, 42% of these patients supplemented
hours for lorazepam.2,3 A 6-day taper of phenobarbital allows              their phenobarbital treatment with long-acting benzodiaze-
patients to immediately discontinue benzodiazepines without                pines. Although the efficacy and safety profile of phenobarbital

ing tapering protocol:​                                                    promising, it may be premature to extrapolate these findings to
  Days 1 and 2:​64.8 mg three times daily                                  an outpatient setting. Additional studies would be beneficial to
  Days 3 and 4:​64.8 mg twice daily                                        determine the safety and efficacy of phenobarbital and establish
  Days 5 and 6:​64.8 mg at bedtime                                         optimal dosing and weaning protocols in the outpatient setting.
  Using this simple protocol, short-acting benzodiazepines can
