abstract: Easy bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in primary care. Use of a bleeding
  assessment tool and a comprehensive history, physical examination, and patient-provided

  can aid diagnosis of a heritable cause. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered,

  blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized
  ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen. Normal PT and
  aPTT results may indicate a platelet disorder. A normal PT result with a prolonged
  aPTT result indicates a disorder of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and a prolonged
  PT result with a normal aPTT result may indicate a disorder of the extrinsic coagulation
  pathway. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended when initial evaluation
  indicates a bleeding disorder or when suspicion remains high despite a normal laboratory
  workup result.

# Bleeding and Bruising: Primary Care Evaluation.

## Abstract

Easy bruising and bleeding are commonly seen in primary care. Use of a bleeding assessment tool and a comprehensive history, physical examination, and patient-provided photographs can help identify causes of abnormal bleeding and bruising. Family history can aid diagnosis of a heritable cause. Nonaccidental trauma should be considered, especially in vulnerable populations. Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood cell count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen. Normal PT and aPTT results may indicate a platelet disorder. A normal PT result with a prolonged aPTT result indicates a disorder of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, and a prolonged PT result with a normal aPTT result may indicate a disorder of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended when initial evaluation indicates a bleeding disorder or when suspicion remains high despite a normal laboratory workup result.
