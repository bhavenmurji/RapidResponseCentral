abstract: The Association of American Medical Colleges reported a shortage of 45,000
  primary care physicians in 2020 and projects shortages of 65,000 by 2025 and 104,900
  by 2030.1 The shortage has been exacerbated by physician retirement due to the COVID-19
  pandemic.2 The increasing deficit is partially because of the decline in medical
  students entering primary care specialties. Interest in family medicine has been
  flat for the past 10 years, and only 13% of U.S. allopathic and osteopathic graduates
  enter Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited family
  medicine programs.3 Most recent residency matches report that only 9% of allopathic
  medical students choose family medicine.4 There has been more interest in primary
  care in osteopathic schools, with 23% of these students expressing an interest in
  primary care.5.
