abstract: 'Hearing loss is a prevalent, chronic condition in the United States; it
  is often gradual and progressive and is underreported by patients and undertreated
  by physicians. The impaired ability to effectively hear and communicate may result
  in negative emotional, cognitive, economic, and social consequences for individuals
  and may pose a safety risk. Questionnaires and smartphone apps are available to
  help identify and evaluate self-perceived hearing loss. Physicians should assess
  for objective hearing impairment when the patient or family member raises a concern
  or if cognitive or mood symptoms are present that could be influenced by hearing
  loss. Three types of hearing loss exist: conductive, sensorineural, and mixed. Pure-tone
  audiometry uses an audiometer and is reported on an audiogram; it is the most accurate
  method for hearing loss detection. It can be used for screening or comprehensive
  testing when combined with tympanometry, speech-reception thresholds, and word-recognition
  testing. Audiograms that show a unilateral or asymmetrical sensorineural hearing
  loss can be signs of retrocochlear pathology and warrant additional evaluation by
  an audiologist and otolaryngologist as well as imaging studies. Medicare Parts A
  and B do not pay for hearing aids, although some Medicare Advantage (Part C) or
  supplemental plans may provide insurance coverage for hearing aids. Less expensive,
  over-the-counter hearing aids may help mild to moderate hearing loss. Family physicians
  should counsel patients on the importance of protecting their hearing.'

## Abstract

Hearing loss is a prevalent, chronic condition in the United States; it is often gradual and progressive and is underreported by patients and undertreated by physicians. The impaired ability to effectively hear and communicate may result in negative emotional, cognitive, economic, and social consequences for individuals and may pose a safety risk. Questionnaires and smartphone apps are available to help identify and evaluate self-perceived hearing loss. Physicians should assess for objective hearing impairment when the patient or family member raises a concern or if cognitive or mood symptoms are present that could be influenced by hearing loss. Three types of hearing loss exist: conductive, sensorineural, and mixed. Pure-tone audiometry uses an audiometer and is reported on an audiogram; it is the most accurate method for hearing loss detection. It can be used for screening or comprehensive testing when combined with tympanometry, speech-reception thresholds, and word-recognition testing. Audiograms that show a unilateral or asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss can be signs of retrocochlear pathology and warrant additional evaluation by an audiologist and otolaryngologist as well as imaging studies. Medicare Parts A and B do not pay for hearing aids, although some Medicare Advantage (Part C) or supplemental plans may provide insurance coverage for hearing aids. Less expensive, over-the-counter hearing aids may help mild to moderate hearing loss. Family physicians should counsel patients on the importance of protecting their hearing.
