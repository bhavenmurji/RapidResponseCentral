abstract: For approximately 500,000 Deaf people in the United States who use American
  Sign Language (ASL), accessing quality health care is challenging.1 Deaf people
  are more likely to have been admitted to a hospital in the past 12 months and have
  a history of chronic illness (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arthritis, HIV, obesity)
  compared with those without hearing impairment.2,3 Contributing factors include
  lack of cultural competency, few appropriately trained ASL interpreters, insufficient
  clinician education, and low health literacy levels.4 Deaf is defined here as people
  who are culturally Deaf (values, traditions, and norms5,6) and use ASL as a primary
  mode of communication.
