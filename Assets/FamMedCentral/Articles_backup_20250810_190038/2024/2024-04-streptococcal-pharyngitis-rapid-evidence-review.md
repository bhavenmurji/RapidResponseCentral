abstract: 'Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection
  responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually.
  Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal
  pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend
  using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal
  infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing
  antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages
  of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral
  etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual
  visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended
  in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics,
  with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended
  for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant
  resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States.
  Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening
  symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days
  after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended
  as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year,
  five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past
  3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.'

## Abstract

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.
