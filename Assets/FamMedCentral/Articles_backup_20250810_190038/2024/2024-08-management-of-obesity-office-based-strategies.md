abstract: 'Obesity in the United States is increasing, with the most recent national
  data indicating a prevalence of 41.9%. Obesity is generally considered a body mass
  index (BMI) of 30 kg per m2 or greater; however, increased waist circumference (female:
  35 inches or greater; male: 40 inches or greater) may be a more accurate indicator
  of obesity, particularly in older adults. For patients who are overweight or obese,
  the history should include whether patients are taking medications that can increase
  weight and identifying comorbid conditions contributing to or resulting from obesity.
  Clinicians should also ask about previous weight-management strategies and whether
  they were effective. Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count,
  metabolic profile, lipids, thyroid-stimulating hormone and A1C levels, and additional
  testing as needed. The Obesity Medicine Association recommends that weight management
  incorporate five pillars: behavioral counseling, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy,
  and, when appropriate, bariatric procedures. Pharmacotherapy with anti-obesity medications
  such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sympathomimetics, and others
  should be considered for any patient with a BMI of 30 kg per m2 or greater and for
  any patients who are overweight (i.e., BMI of 27 kg per m2 or greater) with metabolic
  comorbidities. Referral for bariatric surgery should be considered for patients
  who meet the criteria. Successful management requires individualized support systems
  with periodic follow-ups through each phase of treatment.'

## Abstract

Obesity in the United States is increasing, with the most recent national data indicating a prevalence of 41.9%. Obesity is generally considered a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg per m2 or greater; however, increased waist circumference (female: 35 inches or greater; male: 40 inches or greater) may be a more accurate indicator of obesity, particularly in older adults. For patients who are overweight or obese, the history should include whether patients are taking medications that can increase weight and identifying comorbid conditions contributing to or resulting from obesity. Clinicians should also ask about previous weight-management strategies and whether they were effective. Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, metabolic profile, lipids, thyroid-stimulating hormone and A1C levels, and additional testing as needed. The Obesity Medicine Association recommends that weight management incorporate five pillars: behavioral counseling, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and, when appropriate, bariatric procedures. Pharmacotherapy with anti-obesity medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sympathomimetics, and others should be considered for any patient with a BMI of 30 kg per m2 or greater and for any patients who are overweight (i.e., BMI of 27 kg per m2 or greater) with metabolic comorbidities. Referral for bariatric surgery should be considered for patients who meet the criteria. Successful management requires individualized support systems with periodic follow-ups through each phase of treatment.
