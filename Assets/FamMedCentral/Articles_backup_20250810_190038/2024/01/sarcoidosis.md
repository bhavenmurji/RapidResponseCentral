## Abstract

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that can involve any organ. Ongoing dyspnea and dry cough in a young to middle-aged adult should increase the suspicion for sarcoidosis. Symptoms can present at any age and affect any organ system; however, pulmonary sarcoidosis is the most common. Extrapulmonary manifestations often involve cardiac, neurologic, ocular, and cutaneous systems. Patients with sarcoidosis can exhibit constitutional symptoms such as fever, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue. The early recognition and diagnosis of sarcoidosis are challenging because there is no diagnostic standard for testing, initial symptoms vary, and patients may be asymptomatic. Consensus guidelines recommend a holistic approach when diagnosing sarcoidosis that focuses on clinical presentation and radiographic findings, biopsy with evidence of noncaseating granulomas, involvement of more than one organ system, and elimination of other etiologies of granulomatous disease. Corticosteroids are the initial treatment for active disease, with refractory cases often requiring immunosuppressive or biologic therapies. Transplantation can be considered for advanced and end-stage disease depending on organ involvement.

## Full Text

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous inflammatory disease that can affect any organ. Sarcoidosis commonly affects the lungs and lymph nodes, but the etiology is unknown. This disease is challenging to diagnose and treat due to limited high-quality, evidence-based data. This article discusses the current evidence on the evaluation and treatment of sarcoidosis.

### Epidemiology

Sarcoidosis affects people of all ages and races. The average age at diagnosis is between 44 and 56 years, with children rarely affected. Females are up to twice as likely to have sarcoidosis than males. In the United States, the annual incidence and prevalence are 8 to 11 and 60 to 100 per 100,000, respectively. Incidence and prevalence are higher in Black people for complex reasons requiring further study. The western United States has significantly lower rates of disease than the Northeast, Midwest, or South. Globally, incidence and prevalence estimates have been challenged, but they are reportedly highest in Sweden, the United States, and Canada and lowest in Asian countries. There is an estimated 60% to 70% heritability based on heterogenous studies across populations, suggesting a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

### Pathogenesis

The etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown. Leading theories suggest that sarcoidosis develops after exposure to a foreign antigen, such as bacteria or environmental agents (e.g., insecticides, silica, mold), in an individual with a genetic predisposition that triggers an inflammatory process. Suspected infectious agents include Propionibacterium acnes and Mycobacterium. The interaction between the innate and adaptive immune cells creates an influx of cytokines, triggering an aberrant immune response that leads to the formation of noncaseating granulomas in tissues and organs. Clearance of the antigen leads to remission, whereas the body's failure to clear the antigen leads to chronic disease.

### Natural History

The disease course of sarcoidosis is variable. Approximately one-half of patients experience spontaneous remission after two years, with lower remission rates in later disease stages. One-third of patients may experience sarcoidosis progression at three years, as measured by deterioration in radiographic findings or pulmonary function. The patient's age at the time of diagnosis is associated with disease progression, with one study showing an increased risk of 4% for each additional year after diagnosis. The likelihood of progression was 20% in patients 50 years and older.

Overall mortality in patients with sarcoidosis is similar to the general population. According to a large U.S. mortality database evaluating sarcoidosis as an underlying cause of death, the overall age-adjusted mortality rate is 3.1%. Predictors of mortality include stage 4 disease on chest radiography, pulmonary hypertension, or greater than 20% fibrosis on high-resolution computed tomography (CT). Mortality is higher in Black patients, particularly females; however, the influence of genetics and modifiable risk factors are not adequately understood to report race as an independent predictor of mortality.

### Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of sarcoidosis varies. Pulmonary symptoms, including shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain, occur in 50% of symptomatic patients. Constitutional symptoms, including fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and fever, may occur in up to one-third of patients. One-third of patients with systemic sarcoidosis develop skin lesions. Cutaneous sarcoidosis generally presents as red-brown papules and plaques but can have many variations, including mimicking discoid lupus erythematosus, lichenoid dermatitis, infection, and psoriasis, or appearing as deep subcutaneous nodules (Darier-Roussy sarcoid). Other common extrapulmonary symptoms depend on organ involvement, including visual disturbance (e.g., anterior uveitis), sensory changes, palpitations, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice. Up to 50% of patients are asymptomatic, with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy identified incidentally on chest radiography.

### Diagnosis

Sarcoidosis is a diagnostic challenge because there is no diagnostic standard for testing, the potential exists for an asymptomatic state, multiple organ systems can be affected, and clinical presentation can overlap with other pulmonary processes. Consensus guidelines suggest a holistic diagnostic approach, including elements of clinical presentation and radiographic findings, biopsy-proven noncaseating granuloma, involvement of more than one organ system, and exclusion of other etiologies of granulomatous disease.

#### Laboratory Evaluation

Baseline laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, kidney function testing, liver function testing, electrolyte levels (including calcium), and urinalysis to screen for extrapulmonary involvement and exclude other etiologies. Additional testing may include tuberculosis screening, HIV, and fungal culture depending on patient-specific risk factors (e.g., exposure, travel, geographic location). Approximately 3% to 12% of patients with sarcoidosis have hypercalcemia secondary to increased circulating levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) from macrophages within granulomas. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations are elevated in 50% to 60% of patients with sarcoidosis but have limited use in the diagnosis due to a lack of specificity, failure to correlate with radiographic disease severity, and genotypic interindividual variability.

#### Pulmonary Sarcoidosis

Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with biopsy-confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis have abnormalities on radiography, most commonly bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The Scadding staging system was developed based on chest radiographic features for prognostic purposes:
- Stage I: Bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- Stage II: Parenchymal involvement and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy  
- Stage III: Midlung predominant reticulonodular opacities
- Stage IV: Hilar distortion and elevation with upper lobe-predominant fibrosis

High-resolution CT typically shows upper lobe lymphatic and peribronchovascular nodules and subcarinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Unlike chest radiography, high-resolution CT closely inspects lung parenchyma to aid in quantifying lung fibrosis, which can affect treatment decisions and prognosis.

Pulmonary function testing has normal findings in approximately 80% of patients without parenchymal infiltrates on imaging. Abnormal pulmonary function test patterns vary in sarcoidosis, depending on the distribution of airway inflammation, and include obstructive (commonly found in fibrotic disease), decreased diffusing capacity, and restrictive.

A tissue biopsy of cutaneous lesions or peripheral lymph nodes is the least invasive and safest option for diagnosis. Histopathologic findings of sarcoidosis are characterized by noncaseating granulomas consisting of aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes, giant cells, and mature macrophages. Patients without peripheral lesions may require bronchoscopy procedures such as transbronchial biopsy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, which is 80% to 90% sensitive, with complication rates of less than 1%.

#### Extrapulmonary Sarcoidosis

All patients with a sarcoidosis diagnosis should undergo baseline 12-lead electrocardiography to screen for cardiac involvement. Abnormal findings, such as a higher degree heart block, right bundle branch block, or arrhythmias, should prompt additional evaluation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT.

If neurosarcoidosis is suspected, a brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis with lumbar puncture should be performed. Clinical guidelines recommend a baseline eye examination for all patients with sarcoidosis, and ongoing visual changes should prompt further evaluation.

Several clinical syndromes are pathognomonic for sarcoidosis and do not require a confirmatory tissue biopsy:
- **Lupus pernio**: A type of cutaneous sarcoidosis associated with a poor prognosis and lung involvement
- **Löfgren syndrome**: Associated with a favorable prognosis and characterized by erythema nodosum, uveitis, fevers, polyarthritis, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
- **Uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt syndrome)**: Characterized by uveitis, parotitis, fever, and occasionally facial nerve palsy

### Treatment

#### Pulmonary Sarcoidosis

Patients with no symptoms or mild disease should be observed without treatment because spontaneous resolution is common. Oral corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy, and the decision to administer them should consider the patient's quality of life, degree of disability, and extent of lung involvement. A Cochrane review found that patients treated with corticosteroids had improvements in chest radiograph appearance, symptoms, and spirometry over three to 24 months. However, corticosteroids do not appear to improve mortality, lung function, or disease progression.

The optimal dosage of corticosteroids has not been established. An initial prednisone dosage of 0.5 to 1.0 mg per kg per day (usually 20 to 40 mg per day) can be considered. After one to three months of treatment, patients should be assessed every three to six months. For disease responsive to steroid treatment, the dosage is slowly tapered to 5 to 10 mg per day or every other day for at least 12 months.

Methotrexate is a second-line medication for patients with symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis who are thought to be at higher risk of future mortality or permanent disability. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, such as infliximab, are recommended in patients with persistent symptoms despite treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.

In severe and progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis, prompt referral for possible lung transplantation is appropriate. Patients undergoing lung transplantation because of sarcoidosis have similar survival compared with patients undergoing lung transplant for other indications, with a reported 10-year posttransplant survival rate of 53%.

#### Extrapulmonary Sarcoidosis

**Cardiac Sarcoidosis**: The treatment involves management of any left ventricular dysfunction, following established guidelines for heart failure. Corticosteroids may improve long-term clinical outcomes and resolve atrioventricular block. Surgical options include an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, pacemaker, radiofrequency catheter ablation, and heart transplantation.

**Neurosarcoidosis**: Corticosteroids are considered first-line treatment. Methotrexate can be added for patients who continue to have symptoms. In patients with significant symptoms despite treatment, infliximab can be considered.

**Cutaneous Sarcoidosis**: Erythema nodosum usually resolves in six to eight weeks with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids are generally considered beneficial for limited skin lesions. In patients with cutaneous skin lesions that do not respond to topical treatments, oral corticosteroids can be considered. Antimalarial therapy, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, thalidomide, and Janus kinase inhibitors are immunosuppressive therapies that can be considered.
