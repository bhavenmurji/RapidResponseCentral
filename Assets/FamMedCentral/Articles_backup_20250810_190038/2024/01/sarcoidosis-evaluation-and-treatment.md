abstract: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown
  etiology that can involve any organ. Ongoing dyspnea and dry cough in a young to
  middle-aged adult should increase the suspicion for sarcoidosis. Symptoms can present
  at any age and affect any organ system; however, pulmonary sarcoidosis is the most
  common. Extrapulmonary manifestations often involve cardiac, neurologic, ocular,
  and cutaneous systems. Patients with sarcoidosis can exhibit constitutional symptoms
  such as fever, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue. The early recognition and
  diagnosis of sarcoidosis are challenging because there is no diagnostic standard
  for testing, initial symptoms vary, and patients may be asymptomatic. Consensus
  guidelines recommend a holistic approach when diagnosing sarcoidosis that focuses
  on clinical presentation and radiographic findings, biopsy with evidence of noncaseating
  granulomas, involvement of more than one organ system, and elimination of other
  etiologies of granulomatous disease. Corticosteroids are the initial treatment for
  active disease, with refractory cases often requiring immunosuppressive or biologic
  therapies. Transplantation can be considered for advanced and end-stage disease
  depending on organ involvement.

## Abstract

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that can involve any organ. Ongoing dyspnea and dry cough in a young to middle-aged adult should increase the suspicion for sarcoidosis. Symptoms can present at any age and affect any organ system; however, pulmonary sarcoidosis is the most common. Extrapulmonary manifestations often involve cardiac, neurologic, ocular, and cutaneous systems. Patients with sarcoidosis can exhibit constitutional symptoms such as fever, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue. The early recognition and diagnosis of sarcoidosis are challenging because there is no diagnostic standard for testing, initial symptoms vary, and patients may be asymptomatic. Consensus guidelines recommend a holistic approach when diagnosing sarcoidosis that focuses on clinical presentation and radiographic findings, biopsy with evidence of noncaseating granulomas, involvement of more than one organ system, and elimination of other etiologies of granulomatous disease. Corticosteroids are the initial treatment for active disease, with refractory cases often requiring immunosuppressive or biologic therapies. Transplantation can be considered for advanced and end-stage disease depending on organ involvement.
