abstract: Alzheimer disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized
  by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.
  Alzheimer disease affects cognitive function, leading to memory loss and impairment
  in activities of daily living. Approximately 6.9 million people in the United States
  65 years and older live with Alzheimer disease, a number expected to double by 2060.
  Although there is no cure for Alzheimer disease, treatments are available to manage
  symptoms. Tools such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
  5th ed., criteria aid in identifying major neurocognitive disorders. The evaluation
  involves a comprehensive medical history, cognitive examinations, and collateral
  information. Nonpharmacologic interventions focus on psychosocial approaches, with
  music, sensory stimulation, and validation therapies showing some evidence of reducing
  responsive behaviors. Pharmacologic management, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
  (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist
  memantine, targets symptom relief and disease progression. Vitamin E does not improve
  cognition but may mitigate functional decline. Brexpiprazole has been approved in
  the United States for treating agitation associated with Alzheimer disease. Anti-amyloid
  monoclonal antibody treatments are approved for mild cognitive impairment and mild
  Alzheimer disease, but they are controversial and safety concerns exist. Ineffective
  therapies include ginkgo biloba, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, omega-3 fatty
  acids, and statins.

### Main Content


Alzheimer disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Alzheimer disease affects cognitive function, leading to memory loss and impairment in activities of daily living. Approximately 6.9 million people in the United States 65 years and older live with Alzheimer disease, a number expected to double by 2060. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer disease, treatments are available to manage symptoms. Tools such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., criteria aid in identifying major neurocognitive disorders. The evaluation involves a comprehensive medical history, cognitive examinations, and collateral information. Nonpharmacologic interventions focus on psychosocial approaches, with music, sensory stimulation, and validation therapies showing some evidence of reducing responsive behaviors. Pharmacologic management, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine, targets symptom relief and disease progression. Vitamin E does not improve cognition but may mitigate functional decline. Brexpiprazole has been approved in the United States for treating agitation associated with Alzheimer disease. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody treatments are approved for mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer disease, but they are controversial and safety concerns exist. Ineffective therapies include ginkgo biloba, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, omega-3 fatty acids, and statins.
