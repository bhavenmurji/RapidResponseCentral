## Abstract

Prostatitis is a common clinical syndrome classified into four categories: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Bacterial prostatitis (acute and chronic) is primarily diagnosed with history and microbiologic studies, although physical examination can be helpful to localize infection within the genitourinary system. Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics; the span of treatment is guided by the duration of symptoms and presence of complications. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion with no standardized treatments. Asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment and is usually diagnosed incidentally during the workup for other urologic presentations.
