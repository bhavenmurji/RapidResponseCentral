abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that affects quality
  of life and is associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
  heart failure, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and stroke. OSA
  is characterized by a reduction or cessation of breathing during sleep, resulting
  in intermittent hypoxemia, autonomic fluctuation, and sleep fragmentation. The U.S.
  Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend
  routine screening for OSA in the absence of symptoms. OSA should be considered in
  patients with excessive daytime fatigue, unrestful sleep, persistent snoring, and
  nocturnal awakenings with gasping or choking. The STOP-BANG questionnaire is the
  most sensitive screening tool for OSA, and the diagnostic standard is polysomnography
  with an observed apnea-hypopnea index greater than 5 in the presence of symptoms
  or greater than 15 without symptoms. Home sleep apnea testing is a useful diagnostic
  option in patients who have symptoms consistent with moderate to severe OSA without
  significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Positive airway pressure, with a humidified
  nasal or facial mask, is the first-line treatment for adults with OSA. Weight loss
  is a beneficial adjunct to treatment through intensive lifestyle modification, medications,
  or bariatric surgery. Alternatives for patients intolerant of or nonadherent to
  positive airway pressure include changing the type of mask used, mandibular advancement
  devices, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, and other surgical interventions. Although
  many OSA therapies effectively improve daytime sleepiness and blood pressure, none
  have demonstrated a mortality benefit in randomized controlled trials.
