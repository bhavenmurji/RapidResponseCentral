abstract: Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United
  States, with alcohol-related deaths increasing during the pandemic. The Substance
  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommends that physicians offer
  pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions for patients diagnosed with alcohol
  use disorder. Several medications are available to help patients reduce drinking
  and maintain abstinence; however, in 2019, only 7.3% of Americans with alcohol use
  disorder received any treatment, and only 1.6% were prescribed medications to treat
  the disorder. Strong evidence shows that naltrexone and gabapentin reduce heavy-drinking
  days and that acamprosate prevents return-to-use in patients who are currently abstinent;
  moderate evidence supports the use of topiramate in decreasing heavy-drinking days.
  Disulfiram has been commonly prescribed, but little evidence supports its effectiveness
  outside of supervised settings. Other medications, including varenicline and baclofen,
  may be beneficial in reducing heavy alcohol use. Antidepressants do not decrease
  alcohol use in patients who do not have mood disorders, but they may help patients
  who meet criteria for depression to decrease their alcohol intake. Systematic policies
  are needed to expand the use of medications when treating alcohol use disorder in
  inpatient and outpatient populations.

## Abstract

Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, with alcohol-related deaths increasing during the pandemic. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommends that physicians offer pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions for patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Several medications are available to help patients reduce drinking and maintain abstinence; however, in 2019, only 7.3% of Americans with alcohol use disorder received any treatment, and only 1.6% were prescribed medications to treat the disorder. Strong evidence shows that naltrexone and gabapentin reduce heavy-drinking days and that acamprosate prevents return-to-use in patients who are currently abstinent; moderate evidence supports the use of topiramate in decreasing heavy-drinking days. Disulfiram has been commonly prescribed, but little evidence supports its effectiveness outside of supervised settings. Other medications, including varenicline and baclofen, may be beneficial in reducing heavy alcohol use. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients who do not have mood disorders, but they may help patients who meet criteria for depression to decrease their alcohol intake. Systematic policies are needed to expand the use of medications when treating alcohol use disorder in inpatient and outpatient populations.
