abstract: Hip and knee injections are useful diagnostic and therapeutic tools for
  family physicians. This article reviews anatomic landmark-guided and ultrasound-guided
  injections and aspiration techniques for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the
  hip joint, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, and the iliotibial band. Indications
  for injections include acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid
  arthritis; osteoarthritis; overuse; and traumas. Joint aspirations may be performed
  to aid in the diagnosis of unexplained effusions and to relieve pain. Technique,
  injectant, and follow-up timing depend on the physician's comfort, experience, and
  preference. Infections of the skin or soft tissue are the primary contraindications
  to injections. The most common complications are local inflammatory reactions to
  the injectant. These reactions usually cause soreness for 24 to 48 hours, then spontaneously
  resolve. Follow-up after injections is usually scheduled within two to six weeks.

## Abstract

Hip and knee injections are useful diagnostic and therapeutic tools for family physicians. This article reviews anatomic landmark-guided and ultrasound-guided injections and aspiration techniques for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the hip joint, the knee joint, the pes anserine bursa, and the iliotibial band. Indications for injections include acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; overuse; and traumas. Joint aspirations may be performed to aid in the diagnosis of unexplained effusions and to relieve pain. Technique, injectant, and follow-up timing depend on the physician's comfort, experience, and preference. Infections of the skin or soft tissue are the primary contraindications to injections. The most common complications are local inflammatory reactions to the injectant. These reactions usually cause soreness for 24 to 48 hours, then spontaneously resolve. Follow-up after injections is usually scheduled within two to six weeks.
