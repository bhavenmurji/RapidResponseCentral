abstract: Pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon and carries a poor prognosis because

  treatment approach is best determined by a multidisciplinary, high-volume center.
  For a patient undergoing chemotherapy, nutritional and psychosocial support and
  palliation of symptoms should be goals during treatment.

## Abstract

Pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon and carries a poor prognosis because patients often develop signs or symptoms at a late stage of illness. Patients with a family history, especially those with genetic syndromes, are at a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol use, and obesity. Although patients at increased risk should be screened, screening is not recommended for asymptomatic people at average risk. The differential diagnosis for a symptomatic patient is broad, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, chronic pancreatitis, biliary dyskinesia, cholelithiasis, gastroparesis, or constipation. Initial serologic testing should include transaminase and bilirubin levels, and in patients with midepigastric pain, lipase levels. Pancreas-protocol, contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography is the imaging test of choice. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is the most studied cancer marker and moderately accurate in patients suspected of having cancer; however, the positive predictive value is 0.9% in asymptomatic patients. Treatment includes neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery if the cancer is resectable. The treatment approach is best determined by a multidisciplinary, high-volume center. For a patient undergoing chemotherapy, nutritional and psychosocial support and palliation of symptoms should be goals during treatment.
