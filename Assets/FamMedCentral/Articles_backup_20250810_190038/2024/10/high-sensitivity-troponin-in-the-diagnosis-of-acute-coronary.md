## Diagnosing Common Benign Skin Tumors

Joy Shen-Wagner, Joel Amidon, Stephen Carek

Patients commonly present to family physicians with skin findings, and distinguishing common benign skin tumors from potentially malignant tumors is important. Benign skin tumors can often be diagnosed by their history, distribution, and characteristic morphology.

## Melanoma: Diagnosis and Treatment

Rebecca Lauters, Ashley Dianne Brown, Kari-Claudia Allen Harrington

Risk factors for cutaneous malignant melanoma include increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation from indoor tanning and sun exposure and genetic susceptibility. Clinical tools, such as mnemonics and the ugly duckling sign, and dermoscopy aid in the diagnosis. All suspicious...

## Management of Late-Term and Postterm Pregnancy

Breanna Gawrys, Diana Trang, Whay Cheng

Postterm pregnancy starts at 42 weeks' gestation and late-term pregnancy is between 41 weeks' and 0 days' and 41 weeks' and 6 days' gestation. Accurate first-trimester dating is essential for determining or verifying gestational age. Ideal management of late-term and postterm...

Early recognition and proper diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder can improve outcomes. First-line treatment includes exposure and response therapy, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or both.

## Injections of the Hand and Wrist: Part I. Trigger Finger, First Carpometacarpal Joint Osteoarthritis, and Palmar Fibromatosis

George G. A. Pujalte, Rock Vomer, Neil Shah

Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections to help alleviate pain from hand and finger conditions, especially when conservative treatments are ineffective. Techniques vary, and ultrasound guidance can be helpful.

## Injections of the Hand and Wrist: Part II. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Ganglion Cyst, Intersection Syndrome, Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex Injury, and de Quervain Tenosynovitis

George G. A. Pujalte, Rock Vomer, Neil Shah

Several common wrist pathologies are suitable for therapeutic injection, and family physicians are well-positioned to provide these injections, especially when conservative treatments are ineffective. Techniques vary, and ultrasound guidance can be helpful.

## Adding a LABA or LAMA to Current ICS Therapy for Uncontrolled Asthma

Kyle Jordan Fletke, Nel Trasybule

## Pet Therapy as a Treatment for Anxiety

Mark Zawisa, Urchit Bhatiya, Ian Andrew

Pet therapy is used to treat anxiety because it notably reduces self-reported anxiety across multiple age groups. Most pet therapy studies involve dogs, but cats and horses also have been studied. In patients with dementia, animal-assisted therapy reduces behavioral and...

## High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome

Michael T. Partin, Nathan J. Hemerly, Karl T. Clebak

Compared with conventional assays, hs-cTn assays have a lower limit of detection and a good overall negative predictive value at certain levels in diagnosing acute MI in patients presenting with cardiac symptoms.

## Patient-Centered Contraceptive Counseling: A Reproductive Justice–Informed Shift to Shared Decision-Making

David A. Klein, Ryan L. Williamson, Emily A. Yocom
