## Management of Late-Term and Postterm Pregnancy

Breanna Gawrys, Diana Trang, Whay Cheng

Postterm pregnancy starts at 42 weeks' gestation and late-term pregnancy is between 41 weeks' and 0 days' and 41 weeks' and 6 days' gestation. Accurate first-trimester dating is essential for determining or verifying gestational age. Ideal management of late-term and postterm...

George G. A. Pujalte, Rock Vomer, Neil Shah

## RSV, Testosterone Therapy, Prenatal Medication Risk, Obstructive Sialadenitis, Conjunctivitis, Gout

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Adding a LABA or LAMA to Current ICS Therapy for Uncontrolled Asthma

Kyle Jordan Fletke, Nel Trasybule

Jason W. Deck, Lamont Cavanagh, William Dudney, Joshua Hansen, Thomas Kern, Emrys Moreau

## Pet Therapy as a Treatment for Anxiety

Mark Zawisa, Urchit Bhatiya, Ian Andrew
