abstract: Treatment-resistant depression is defined as absence of remission despite
  trials of two or more antidepressant medications and can occur in up to 31% of patients
  with major depressive disorder. Partial response to treatment is defined as less
  than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant
  depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration
  of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy,
  switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications.
  Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant,
  an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine
  medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as
  augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation.
  Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be
  effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended.
  Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary
  changes.

## Abstract

Treatment-resistant depression is defined as absence of remission despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications and can occur in up to 31% of patients with major depressive disorder. Partial response to treatment is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications. Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary changes.

## Saw Palmetto for the Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Saw palmetto, alone or in combination with other phytotherapeutic agents, does not improve urologic symptoms or quality of life in the short term (3 to 6 months) or long term (12 to 17 months). Also, it does not cause significant adverse events.

## Antidepressants to Aid in Smoking Cessation
