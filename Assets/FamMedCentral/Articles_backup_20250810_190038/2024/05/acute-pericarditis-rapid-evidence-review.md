abstract: 'Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs
  in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic
  chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies
  of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral.
  Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or
  worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial
  friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations
  or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient,
  and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic
  electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave,
  upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions.
  Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis
  to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should
  be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those
  who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks'' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory
  conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line
  treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications
  should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.'

# Acute Pericarditis: Rapid Evidence Review.

## Abstract

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral. Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

This article reviews patient-oriented evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of acute pericarditis.

## Falls in Older Adults: Approach and Prevention

Jessica S. Coulter, Jessica Randazzo, Erinn E. Kary, Haroon Samar

Clinicians should screen older adults for fall risk, and if results are abnormal, multicomponent interventions are indicated. These include optimizing care of chronic medical conditions, evaluating home safety, and avoiding polypharmacy and drugs that increase fall risk.

Brett D. Thombs, Sarah Markham, Danielle B. Rice, Roy C. Ziegelstein

Adding anxiety screening tests takes time away from critical health care tasks and is not likely to benefit patients compared with good standard care.

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Hyaluronic Acid Products for Chronic Wound Healing

Melinda W. Ng, Christina Valerio

Because of the significant risk of blinding bias and imprecision in the results as well as inadequate assessment of harms, a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) is assigned for use of hyaluronic acid for chronic wounds.

## Saw Palmetto for the Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Saw palmetto, alone or in combination with other phytotherapeutic agents, does not improve urologic symptoms or quality of life in the short term (3 to 6 months) or long term (12 to 17 months). Also, it does not cause significant adverse events.

## Antidepressants to Aid in Smoking Cessation

William D. Nettleton, Jessel Ramdass

Bupropion facilitates tobacco cessation reported at 6 months of follow-up compared with placebo or no pharmacological treatment. More people discontinue using bupropion due to adverse effects than those using placebo or no pharmacological treatment.

## Screening for Anxiety Disorders in Adults

The USPSTF recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for anxiety disorders in older adults.
