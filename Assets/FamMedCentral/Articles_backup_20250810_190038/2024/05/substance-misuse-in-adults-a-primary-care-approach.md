abstract: Substance misuse and substance use disorder continue to be major causes
  of morbidity and mortality, and family physicians are well positioned to provide
  evidence-based prevention and management for these conditions. Of people 12 years
  and older, 13% reported using a nonprescribed controlled substance in the past month,
  and 24% had at least one episode of binge drinking of alcohol, defined as five or
  more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women on one occasion. Benzodiazepines
  are used by 12% of the U.S. population. Clinicians should incorporate standardized
  screening and brief intervention for use of alcohol and other substances into routine
  care of adult patients, as well as referral to specialized treatment services when
  indicated. Use of nonstigmatizing, person-first language has been shown to positively
  affect care for patients with substance use disorders. Alcohol screening and brief
  intervention have been shown to reduce excessive drinking by 40% in patients at
  6 months postintervention. Office-based treatment of alcohol use disorder with medications
  approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as acamprosate and naltrexone,
  remains underutilized, presenting another opportunity for family physicians to positively
  affect the health of their patients and communities. With elimination of the X-waiver,
  any clinician with Schedule III prescriptive authority can treat opioid use disorder
  with buprenorphine in their office-based practice. Opioid overdose education and
  naloxone coprescribing are other tools family physicians can employ to combat the
  overdose crisis.

## Abstract

Substance misuse and substance use disorder continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality, and family physicians are well positioned to provide evidence-based prevention and management for these conditions. Of people 12 years and older, 13% reported using a nonprescribed controlled substance in the past month, and 24% had at least one episode of binge drinking of alcohol, defined as five or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women on one occasion. Benzodiazepines are used by 12% of the U.S. population. Clinicians should incorporate standardized screening and brief intervention for use of alcohol and other substances into routine care of adult patients, as well as referral to specialized treatment services when indicated. Use of nonstigmatizing, person-first language has been shown to positively affect care for patients with substance use disorders. Alcohol screening and brief intervention have been shown to reduce excessive drinking by 40% in patients at 6 months postintervention. Office-based treatment of alcohol use disorder with medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as acamprosate and naltrexone, remains underutilized, presenting another opportunity for family physicians to positively affect the health of their patients and communities. With elimination of the X-waiver, any clinician with Schedule III prescriptive authority can treat opioid use disorder with buprenorphine in their office-based practice. Opioid overdose education and naloxone coprescribing are other tools family physicians can employ to combat the overdose crisis.

## Depression: Managing Resistance and Partial Response to Treatment

Heidi L. Gaddey, Brandyn Mason, Amol Naik

Treatment-resistant depression is absence of remission despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications; partial response to treatment is less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Management includes adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication...

## Evaluation and Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting in Adults

Tracy Johns, Elizabeth Lawrence

In the absence of alarm symptoms, nausea and vomiting are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Chronic symptoms require a careful history to narrow the differential diagnosis. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist...

## Substance Misuse in Adults: A Primary Care Approach

Alicia Kowalchuk, Sandra J. Gonzalez, Roger J. Zoorob

The medical approach to substance use has significantly changed over the past decade. New tools for prevention, screening, assessment, and treatment have been adopted, and family physicians are well positioned to provide prevention and management.

## Acute Pericarditis: Rapid Evidence Review

Thomas A. Peterson, Sean P. Turner, Katelyn A. Dolezal

This article reviews patient-oriented evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of acute pericarditis.

## Falls in Older Adults: Approach and Prevention

Jessica S. Coulter, Jessica Randazzo, Erinn E. Kary, Haroon Samar

Clinicians should screen older adults for fall risk, and if results are abnormal, multicomponent interventions are indicated. These include optimizing care of chronic medical conditions, evaluating home safety, and avoiding polypharmacy and drugs that increase fall risk.

## Diagnostic and Therapeutic Advances in Cystic Fibrosis: How Family Physicians Can Partner in Care

Melanie Sue Collins, Kenia Mansilla-Rivera

Patients with cystic fibrosis are living longer, healthier lives and are now facing many of the same ongoing health challenges as people without the condition.

## Anxiety Screening Is Unlikely to Improve Mental Health Outcomes

Brett D. Thombs, Sarah Markham, Danielle B. Rice, Roy C. Ziegelstein

Adding anxiety screening tests takes time away from critical health care tasks and is not likely to benefit patients compared with good standard care.

## Esophageal Cancer, Uterine Bleeding, HIV, Bariatric Surgery and Pregnancy, Venous Thromboembolism, Renal Colic

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Hyaluronic Acid Products for Chronic Wound Healing

Melinda W. Ng, Christina Valerio

Because of the significant risk of blinding bias and imprecision in the results as well as inadequate assessment of harms, a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) is assigned for use of hyaluronic acid for chronic wounds.

## Saw Palmetto for the Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Saw palmetto, alone or in combination with other phytotherapeutic agents, does not improve urologic symptoms or quality of life in the short term (3 to 6 months) or long term (12 to 17 months). Also, it does not cause significant adverse events.

## Antidepressants to Aid in Smoking Cessation

William D. Nettleton, Jessel Ramdass

Bupropion facilitates tobacco cessation reported at 6 months of follow-up compared with placebo or no pharmacological treatment. More people discontinue using bupropion due to adverse effects than those using placebo or no pharmacological treatment.

## Screening for Anxiety Disorders in Adults

The USPSTF recommends screening for anxiety disorders in adults, including pregnant and postpartum persons. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for anxiety disorders in older adults.

## Screening for Anxiety Disorders in Adults
