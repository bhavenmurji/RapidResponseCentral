abstract: Family physicians often treat patients who require urinary management with
  the use of external urinary devices, clean intermittent catheterization, or indwelling
  urinary catheterization. External urinary devices are indicated for urinary incontinence
  (postvoid residual less than 300 mL), urine volume measurement for hospitalized
  patients, nonsterile urine diagnostic testing, improved comfort for patients in
  hospice or palliative care, and fall prevention for high-risk patients. Indwelling
  urinary catheterization is indicated for severe urinary retention or bladder outlet
  obstruction; wound healing in the sacrum, buttocks, or perineal area; prolonged
  immobilization; and as a palliative measure for patients who are terminally ill.
  Clean intermittent catheterization is an alternative to indwelling urinary catheterization
  for acute or chronic urinary retention (postvoid residual greater than 300 mL) without
  bladder outlet obstruction, sterile urine testing, postvoid residual volume assessment,
  and wound healing. Suprapubic catheter placement is considered when long-term catheterization
  is needed or urethral catheterization is not feasible. Urinary catheters should
  not be used solely for staff or caregiver convenience, incontinence-related dermatitis,
  urine culture procurement from a voiding patient, or initial incontinence management.
  Common complications of urinary catheter use include obstruction, bladder spasm,
  urine leakage, and skin breakdown of the sacrum, buttocks, or perineum. The risk
  of catheter-associated urinary tract infections increases with the duration of catheter
  use. Urologist referral is indicated for patients requiring urinary management who
  have recurrent urinary tract infections, acute infectious urinary retention, suspected
  urethral injury, or substantial urethral discomfort or if long-term catheterization
  is being considered.

## Abstract

Family physicians often treat patients who require urinary management with the use of external urinary devices, clean intermittent catheterization, or indwelling urinary catheterization. External urinary devices are indicated for urinary incontinence (postvoid residual less than 300 mL), urine volume measurement for hospitalized patients, nonsterile urine diagnostic testing, improved comfort for patients in hospice or palliative care, and fall prevention for high-risk patients. Indwelling urinary catheterization is indicated for severe urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction; wound healing in the sacrum, buttocks, or perineal area; prolonged immobilization; and as a palliative measure for patients who are terminally ill. Clean intermittent catheterization is an alternative to indwelling urinary catheterization for acute or chronic urinary retention (postvoid residual greater than 300 mL) without bladder outlet obstruction, sterile urine testing, postvoid residual volume assessment, and wound healing. Suprapubic catheter placement is considered when long-term catheterization is needed or urethral catheterization is not feasible. Urinary catheters should not be used solely for staff or caregiver convenience, incontinence-related dermatitis, urine culture procurement from a voiding patient, or initial incontinence management. Common complications of urinary catheter use include obstruction, bladder spasm, urine leakage, and skin breakdown of the sacrum, buttocks, or perineum. The risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections increases with the duration of catheter use. Urologist referral is indicated for patients requiring urinary management who have recurrent urinary tract infections, acute infectious urinary retention, suspected urethral injury, or substantial urethral discomfort or if long-term catheterization is being considered.

Family physicians often treat patients who require urinary management with the use of external urinary devices, clean intermittent catheterization, or indwelling urinary catheterization. External urinary devices are indicated for urinary incontinence (postvoid residual less than 300 mL), urine volume measurement for hospitalized patients, nonsterile urine diagnostic testing, improved comfort for patients in hospice or palliative care, and fall prevention for high-risk patients. Indwelling urinary catheterization is indicated for severe urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction; wound healing in the sacrum, buttocks, or perineal area; prolonged immobilization; and as a palliative measure for patients who are terminally ill. Clean intermittent catheterization is an alternative to indwelling urinary catheterization for acute or chronic urinary retention (postvoid residual greater than 300 mL) without bladder outlet obstruction, sterile urine testing, postvoid residual volume assessment, and wound healing. Suprapubic catheter placement is considered when long-term catheterization is needed or urethral catheterization is not feasible. Urinary catheters should not be used solely for staff or caregiver convenience, incontinence-related dermatitis, urine culture procurement from a voiding patient, or initial incontinence management. Common complications of urinary catheter use include obstruction, bladder spasm, urine leakage, and skin breakdown of the sacrum, buttocks, or perineum. The risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections increases with the duration of catheter use. Urologist referral is indicated for patients requiring urinary management who have recurrent urinary tract infections, acute infectious urinary retention, suspected urethral injury, or substantial urethral discomfort or if long-term catheterization is being considered.
