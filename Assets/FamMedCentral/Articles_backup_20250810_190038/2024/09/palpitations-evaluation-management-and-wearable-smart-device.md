abstract: Palpitations are a common symptom described by patients as a feeling of
  a racing or fluttering heart, a pounding chest, irregular or skipped heartbeats,
  or a pounding sensation in the neck. They are associated with a low mortality rate;
  however, recurrent palpitations have been shown to impair quality of life and increase
  health care use. Common triggers are cardiac disorders, endocrine and metabolic
  disorders, medication or illicit drug use, or psychosomatic disorders. A detailed
  history, physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and 12-lead electrocardiography
  are often sufficient to identify the etiology of palpitations. Additional testing
  may be indicated to include echocardiography, cardiac stress testing, electrocardiogram
  monitoring, or electrophysiologic studies to distinguish whether symptoms correlate
  with cardiac arrhythmia or structural or ischemic heart disease. Management of palpitations
  is based on the suspected etiology. In most cases of cardiac-induced palpitations,
  the treatment can include reassurance, education, trigger avoidance, or use of atrioventricular
  nodal blockers. Tachyarrhythmias may require cardiac ablation. Patients who have
  palpitations with no arrhythmia causality and no cardiac disease should be reassured;
  however, screening for psychosomatic disorders should be considered. Wearable smart
  devices with ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring technologies are currently
  available to consumers; these tools have shown diagnostic accuracy for detection
  of arrhythmias, allowing patients to have greater participation in their health
  care. Am Fam Physician. 2024; 110(3):259-269.

## Abstract

Palpitations are a common symptom described by patients as a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart, a pounding chest, irregular or skipped heartbeats, or a pounding sensation in the neck. They are associated with a low mortality rate; however, recurrent palpitations have been shown to impair quality of life and increase health care use. Common triggers are cardiac disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, medication or illicit drug use, or psychosomatic disorders. A detailed history, physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and 12-lead electrocardiography are often sufficient to identify the etiology of palpitations. Additional testing may be indicated to include echocardiography, cardiac stress testing, electrocardiogram monitoring, or electrophysiologic studies to distinguish whether symptoms correlate with cardiac arrhythmia or structural or ischemic heart disease. Management of palpitations is based on the suspected etiology. In most cases of cardiac-induced palpitations, the treatment can include reassurance, education, trigger avoidance, or use of atrioventricular nodal blockers. Tachyarrhythmias may require cardiac ablation. Patients who have palpitations with no arrhythmia causality and no cardiac disease should be reassured; however, screening for psychosomatic disorders should be considered. Wearable smart devices with ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring technologies are currently available to consumers; these tools have shown diagnostic accuracy for detection of arrhythmias, allowing patients to have greater participation in their health care.

## Surgical vs. Nonsurgical Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Bless Jung, Jeffrey Leggit, Patient Perspective by John James

Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome probably results in some clinical improvement compared with splinting in the long term (more than 3 months), but it does not appear to lead to clinically significant improvement in symptoms or hand function. Similarly, surgery does not...

## Treatment Options for Morton Neuroma

Dongsheng Jiang, Juan Qiu, Patient Perspective by John James

In patients with Morton neuroma, combined corticosteroid/local anesthetic injection does not improve pain, function, or quality of life at 3 to 6 months vs. local anesthetic injection alone. More adverse events, including skin and plantar fat pad atrophy and hypopigmentation,...

## CCTA to Evaluate for Coronary Artery Stenosis in Intermediate-Risk Patients With Stable Chest Pain

Allison Karlan Kaplan, Nicholas Whitbeck

CCTA is preferred over ICA for evaluation of stable chest pain in intermediate-risk patients without known CAD because it is noninvasive, widely available, and has high patient satisfaction and lower procedural complications.

## Routine Vitamin D Testing: Unnecessary and Ineffective

Andy Lazris, Alan Roth, Patient perspective by Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering health care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

Using demographic and laboratory data, what is the best way to assess the likelihood that a patient will experience a cardiovascular event in the next 10 or 30 years?

## Intra-Articular Steroids for Adhesive Capsulitis

Andrew K. Cunningham, Chih Kai (Kevin) Yang

Intra-articular steroid injections inconsistently improve pain and function when used to treat adhesive capsulitis in the short term (less than 12 weeks) and medium term (less than 6 months). Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy of injection into the glenohumeral joint, but...
