## Palpitations: Evaluation, Management, and Wearable Smart Devices

Robert L. Gauer, Melanie F. Thomas, Ryan A. McNutt

The presence of palpitations is associated with a low mortality rate, but routine palpitations can impair quality of life. A detailed history, focused physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and electrocardiography are often sufficient to identify the etiology of...

## Cushing's Syndrome: Rapid Evidence Review

David L. Maness, Grant Studebaker, Christopher M. Knight

Family physicians have an important role in recognizing the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, ordering initial tests, referring patients to the appropriate specialists, and following up with patients and their families.

Given the benefits of aids on decision-making without any significant harms, a color recommendation of green (benefits greater than harms) has been assigned for the use of decision aids for patients facing health treatment or screening decisions.

## Surgical vs. Nonsurgical Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Bless Jung, Jeffrey Leggit, Patient Perspective by John James

Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome probably results in some clinical improvement compared with splinting in the long term (more than 3 months), but it does not appear to lead to clinically significant improvement in symptoms or hand function. Similarly, surgery does not...

## Treatment Options for Morton Neuroma

Dongsheng Jiang, Juan Qiu, Patient Perspective by John James

In patients with Morton neuroma, combined corticosteroid/local anesthetic injection does not improve pain, function, or quality of life at 3 to 6 months vs. local anesthetic injection alone. More adverse events, including skin and plantar fat pad atrophy and hypopigmentation,...
