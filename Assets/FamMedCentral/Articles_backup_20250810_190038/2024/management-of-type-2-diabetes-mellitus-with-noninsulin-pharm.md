abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is increasing in global
  prevalence. An individualized approach to pharmacotherapy should consider costs,
  benefits beyond glucose control, and adverse events. Metformin is the first-line
  therapy due to its low cost and effectiveness. Sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones
  are additional low-cost oral hypoglycemic classes available in the United States;
  however, evidence shows variability in weight gain and hypoglycemia. Thiazolidinediones
  increase fluid retention and are not recommended in patients with New York Heart
  Association class III or IV heart failure. Newer medications, including glucagon-like
  peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, have
  demonstrated weight loss, reduced cardiovascular events, decreased renal disease,
  and improved all-cause morbidity and mortality. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors
  are recommended for people with known cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and
  chronic kidney disease but carry an increased risk of urinary tract and mycotic
  infections. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in patients
  with active multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or a personal or family history
  of medullary thyroid carcinoma; adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset and
  pancreatitis. Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors have a low risk of hypoglycemia
  but may increase the risk of pancreatitis and require a renal dose adjustment. Public
  and private programs to increase access to newer hypoglycemic medications are increasing;
  however, there are limitations to access, particularly for uninsured and underinsured
  people.

## Audiometry Interpretation for Hearing Loss in Adults

Mandi Sehgal, Alexandra Sellers, Wendy S. Biggs

Individuals' impaired ability to hear and communicate may result in negative emotional, cognitive, economic, and social consequences. Objective hearing impairment should be assessed when a patient or family member raises a concern or if cognitive or mood symptoms are present...

Men who have sex with men are disproportionately affected by HIV infection, anal cancer, syphilis, and depression. Preventive care includes supplementary immunizations, additional screenings, and counseling to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, such as...

## Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With Noninsulin Pharmacotherapy

Elizabeth M. Vaughan, Zuleica M. Santiago-Delgado

An individualized approach to noninsulin pharmacotherapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus should consider costs, benefits beyond glucose control, and adverse events. Metformin is first-line therapy due to cost and effectiveness. Newer agents also provide benefits...

## Streptococcal Pharyngitis: Rapid Evidence Review

Jennifer L. Hamilton, Leon McCrea, II

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection; fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and age younger than 15 years increase clinical suspicion. Diagnosis involves the use of validated clinical decision rules and rapid antigen testing....

## Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: Diagnosis and Management
