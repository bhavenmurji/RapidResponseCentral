abstract: Pregnancy dating is determined by the patient's last menstrual period or
  an ultrasound measurement. A full-term pregnancy is considered 37 weeks' gestation
  or more. Spontaneous labor begins when regular painful uterine contractions result
  in a cervical change. Active labor begins at 6 cm dilation and is marked by more
  predictable, accelerated cervical change. In the absence of pregnancy complications,
  intermittent fetal auscultation may be considered as an alternative to continuous
  electronic fetal monitoring, which is associated with a high false-positive rate.
  Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in patients with group B streptococcus
  colonization or those at high risk to prevent newborn early-onset group B streptococcus.
  The likelihood of vaginal delivery is increased by providing continuous nonmedical
  support during labor, encouraging mobility, and using a peanut ball with epidural
  analgesia. Neuraxial analgesia is more effective for pain control than systemic
  opioids and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Delayed pushing during the
  second stage of labor has risks but does not affect the mode of delivery. Routine
  oropharyngeal suctioning of the newborn is not recommended, even with meconium-stained
  amniotic fluid. Delayed cord clamping reduces newborn anemia. Prevention of postpartum
  hemorrhage in patients at risk includes prophylactic uterotonic administration and
  controlled cord traction. Perineal lacerations that alter anatomy or are not hemostatic
  should be repaired. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):525-532.

# Management of Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery.

## Abstract

Pregnancy dating is determined by the patient's last menstrual period or an ultrasound measurement. A full-term pregnancy is considered 37 weeks' gestation or more. Spontaneous labor begins when regular painful uterine contractions result in a cervical change. Active labor begins at 6 cm dilation and is marked by more predictable, accelerated cervical change. In the absence of pregnancy complications, intermittent fetal auscultation may be considered as an alternative to continuous electronic fetal monitoring, which is associated with a high false-positive rate. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in patients with group B streptococcus colonization or those at high risk to prevent newborn early-onset group B streptococcus. The likelihood of vaginal delivery is increased by providing continuous nonmedical support during labor, encouraging mobility, and using a peanut ball with epidural analgesia. Neuraxial analgesia is more effective for pain control than systemic opioids and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Delayed pushing during the second stage of labor has risks but does not affect the mode of delivery. Routine oropharyngeal suctioning of the newborn is not recommended, even with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Delayed cord clamping reduces newborn anemia. Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in patients at risk includes prophylactic uterotonic administration and controlled cord traction. Perineal lacerations that alter anatomy or are not hemostatic should be repaired. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):525-532.

## Combined Oral Contraceptives for Primary Dysmenorrhea

Dustin K. Smith, Bristal Thompson, Samantha Keefer, Helen Haskell

In early postmenopausal women, systemic estrogen slightly improves sexual function (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain). However, it is not clear whether other types of hormone therapy improve sexual function in postmenopausal women.
