abstract: Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or
  lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help
  patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home
  management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who
  are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance,
  or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting
  beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years
  of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can
  be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In
  the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a
  short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated
  doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids.
  Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility
  and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist,
  and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium
  sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing
  admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar
  to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced
  expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted
  values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids,
  consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education
  on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

## Abstract

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.
