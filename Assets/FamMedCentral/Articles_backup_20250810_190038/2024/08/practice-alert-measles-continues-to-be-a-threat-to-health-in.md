## Blood Pressure Control for Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy

More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP.

## Diagnosing Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Patients

Kiyomi K. Goto, Juan Qiu, John James

## Interventions to Prevent Falls in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
