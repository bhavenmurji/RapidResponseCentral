## Mastitis: Rapid Evidence Review

Erin F. Morcomb, Carmen M. Dargel, Sydney A. Anderson

Mastitis is a spectrum of disorders resulting from inflammation in the mammary glands and is usually associated with lactation. This article provides a review of the best available patient-oriented evidence for mastitis spectrum disorders.

## Pulmonary Hypertension

Kelly Latimer, Michael Layne, Maya Payne

Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. A delayed diagnosis is common because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or lung disease.

## Continuity Matters: Financial Impact of the G2211 Code in Primary Care

## Blood Pressure Control for Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy

More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP.

## Diagnosing Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Patients

Kiyomi K. Goto, Juan Qiu, John James

## Interventions to Prevent Falls in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
