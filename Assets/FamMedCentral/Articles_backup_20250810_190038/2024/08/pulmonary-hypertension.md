abstract: Pulmonary hypertension includes a diverse set of conditions defined by a
  mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg found during right heart catheterization
  that can lead to right-sided heart failure and death if untreated. The most common
  cause of pulmonary hypertension is left-sided heart failure, followed by chronic
  obstructive lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea
  on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. The diagnosis is
  commonly delayed because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or
  lung disease. Echocardiography is the initial study of choice, and findings can
  suggest a low, intermediate, or high risk of pulmonary hypertension. Right heart
  catheterization is the standard of care for diagnosing and classifying pulmonary
  hypertension, and the results may inform treatment. Patients with pulmonary hypertension
  should be referred to a center specializing in treatment. Patients with pulmonary
  hypertension have a high risk of perioperative complications, and detailed specialty
  preoperative evaluation is recommended. Physicians should counsel patients of childbearing
  age with pulmonary hypertension to prevent pregnancy to avoid worsening the severity
  of pulmonary hypertension and fetal loss. Pulmonary hypertension is severe, chronic,
  progressive, and challenging to treat; therefore, family physicians should update
  the patient's immunization status, screen for and address mental health conditions,
  and discuss goals of care and advance directives with patients.

## Abstract

Pulmonary hypertension includes a diverse set of conditions defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg found during right heart catheterization that can lead to right-sided heart failure and death if untreated. The most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left-sided heart failure, followed by chronic obstructive lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. The diagnosis is commonly delayed because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or lung disease. Echocardiography is the initial study of choice, and findings can suggest a low, intermediate, or high risk of pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterization is the standard of care for diagnosing and classifying pulmonary hypertension, and the results may inform treatment. Patients with pulmonary hypertension should be referred to a center specializing in treatment. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have a high risk of perioperative complications, and detailed specialty preoperative evaluation is recommended. Physicians should counsel patients of childbearing age with pulmonary hypertension to prevent pregnancy to avoid worsening the severity of pulmonary hypertension and fetal loss. Pulmonary hypertension is severe, chronic, progressive, and challenging to treat; therefore, family physicians should update the patient's immunization status, screen for and address mental health conditions, and discuss goals of care and advance directives with patients.

Mastitis is a spectrum of disorders resulting from inflammation in the mammary glands and is usually associated with lactation. This article provides a review of the best available patient-oriented evidence for mastitis spectrum disorders.

## Pulmonary Hypertension

Kelly Latimer, Michael Layne, Maya Payne

Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. A delayed diagnosis is common because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or lung disease.

## Continuity Matters: Financial Impact of the G2211 Code in Primary Care

Chrystal Pristell, Hoon Byun, Jeongyoung Park

Family medicine is financially undervalued compared with other medical specialties, and reimbursement fails to recognize the valuable longitudinal care provided to patients. To address continuity, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services created the G2211 code in 2019...

More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP.

## Diagnosing Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Patients
