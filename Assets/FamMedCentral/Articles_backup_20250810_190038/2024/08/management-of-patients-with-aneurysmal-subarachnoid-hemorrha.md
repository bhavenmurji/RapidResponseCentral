## Pulmonary Hypertension

Kelly Latimer, Michael Layne, Maya Payne

Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. A delayed diagnosis is common because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or lung disease.

## Blood Pressure Control for Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy

More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP.

## Diagnosing Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Patients

Kiyomi K. Goto, Juan Qiu, John James
