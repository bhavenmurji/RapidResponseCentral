Erin F. Morcomb, Carmen M. Dargel, Sydney A. Anderson

Mastitis is a spectrum of disorders resulting from inflammation in the mammary glands and is usually associated with lactation. This article provides a review of the best available patient-oriented evidence for mastitis spectrum disorders.

## Pulmonary Hypertension

## Blood Pressure Control for Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy

More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP.

## Diagnosing Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Patients

Kiyomi K. Goto, Juan Qiu, John James

## Interventions to Prevent Falls in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
