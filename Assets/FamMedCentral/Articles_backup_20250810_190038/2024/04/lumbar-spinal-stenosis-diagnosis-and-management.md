abstract: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome that affects more than 200,000
  people in the United States annually. It is a common cause of chronic insidious
  low back pain, especially in older patient populations (mean age = 64 years). Lumbar
  spinal stenosis is a degenerative condition of the spine leading to narrowing in
  the spaces around the neurovascular bundles and the classic symptom of low back
  pain that radiates to the buttocks and lower extremities bilaterally. It is typically
  a progressive waxing and waning process that may deteriorate over years. The pain
  is typically burning or cramping, which worsens with standing and walking and improves
  with bending forward or sitting. Magnetic resonance imaging is the recommended diagnostic
  test because it allows cross-sectional measurement of the spinal canal. Options
  for nonsurgical management include physical therapy, exercise programs, spinal injections
  with and without corticosteroids, chiropractic treatment, osteopathic manipulation,
  acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications; however, few of these treatments have
  high-quality randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness. Surgery may be considered
  if nonsurgical management is ineffective.

## Abstract

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome that affects more than 200,000 people in the United States annually. It is a common cause of chronic insidious low back pain, especially in older patient populations (mean age = 64 years). Lumbar spinal stenosis is a degenerative condition of the spine leading to narrowing in the spaces around the neurovascular bundles and the classic symptom of low back pain that radiates to the buttocks and lower extremities bilaterally. It is typically a progressive waxing and waning process that may deteriorate over years. The pain is typically burning or cramping, which worsens with standing and walking and improves with bending forward or sitting. Magnetic resonance imaging is the recommended diagnostic test because it allows cross-sectional measurement of the spinal canal. Options for nonsurgical management include physical therapy, exercise programs, spinal injections with and without corticosteroids, chiropractic treatment, osteopathic manipulation, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications; however, few of these treatments have high-quality randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness. Surgery may be considered if nonsurgical management is ineffective.
