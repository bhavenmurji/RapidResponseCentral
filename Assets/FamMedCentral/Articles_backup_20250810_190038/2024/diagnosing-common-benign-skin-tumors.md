abstract: Patients commonly present to family physicians with skin findings, and distinguishing
  common benign skin tumors from potentially malignant tumors is important. Benign
  skin tumors can often be diagnosed by their history, distribution, and characteristic
  morphology. A biopsy or excision is indicated if there is diagnostic uncertainty
  or the lesion undergoes uncharacteristic or rapid change. A keratoacanthoma is a
  dome-shaped nodule with a central crater and can be difficult to distinguish from
  squamous cell carcinomas even with dermoscopy. Pilar cysts are typically benign,
  but rapidly growing types could have malignant qualities. Dermoid cysts, depending
  on their location, can have intracranial extension if untreated. Although dermatofibromas
  and seborrheic keratoses are benign, atypical presentations must be differentiated
  from melanomas. Sebaceous hyperplasia can mimic early basal cell carcinoma. Treatment
  options for cherry angiomas, acrochordons, slow-growing pilar cysts, and dermatofibromas
  should be individualized to skin type, lesion characteristics, and the patient's
  cosmetic preference. Generally, excision is the treatment of choice for keratoacanthomas,
  rapidly proliferating pilar cysts, and dermoid cysts. Cherry angiomas are treated
  with laser therapy and sebaceous hyperplasia with electrodesiccation. Common treatments
  for acrochordons and seborrheic keratoses are shave excision and cryotherapy. Pyogenic
  granulomas sometimes self-involute but bleed easily and often recur at the original
  site. They generally respond to shave excision and electrodesiccation. In patients
  with darker skin, treatment with cryotherapy and laser therapy should include discussions
  about hypopigmentation risk.
