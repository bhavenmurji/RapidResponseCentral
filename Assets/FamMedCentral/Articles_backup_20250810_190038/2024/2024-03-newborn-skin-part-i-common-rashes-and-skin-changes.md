abstract: Rashes in the newborn period are common and most are benign. Infections
  should be suspected in newborns with pustules or vesicles, especially in those who
  are not well-appearing or have risk factors for congenital infection. Congenital
  cytomegalovirus infection can cause sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental
  delay. Skin manifestations of cytomegalovirus may include petechiae due to thrombocytopenia.
  The most common skin manifestations of early congenital syphilis are small, copper-red,
  maculopapular lesions located primarily on the hands and feet that peel and crust
  over three weeks. Erythema toxicum neonatorum and neonatal pustular melanosis are
  transient pustular rashes with characteristic appearance and distribution. Neonatal
  acne is self-limited, whereas infantile acne may benefit from treatment. Milia can
  be differentiated from neonatal acne by their presence at birth. Cutis marmorata
  and harlequin color change are transient vascular phenomena resulting from inappropriate
  or exaggerated dilation of capillaries and venules in response to stimuli.

# Newborn Skin: Part I. Common Rashes and Skin Changes.

**Authors:** Snyder, Katherine A M, Voelckers, Adam D

## Abstract

Rashes in the newborn period are common and most are benign. Infections should be suspected in newborns with pustules or vesicles, especially in those who are not well-appearing or have risk factors for congenital infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can cause sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay. Skin manifestations of cytomegalovirus may include petechiae due to thrombocytopenia. The most common skin manifestations of early congenital syphilis are small, copper-red, maculopapular lesions located primarily on the hands and feet that peel and crust over three weeks. Erythema toxicum neonatorum and neonatal pustular melanosis are transient pustular rashes with characteristic appearance and distribution. Neonatal acne is self-limited, whereas infantile acne may benefit from treatment. Milia can be differentiated from neonatal acne by their presence at birth. Cutis marmorata and harlequin color change are transient vascular phenomena resulting from inappropriate or exaggerated dilation of capillaries and venules in response to stimuli.
