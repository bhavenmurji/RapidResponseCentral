abstract: 'Obesity in the United States is increasing, with the most recent national
  data indicating a prevalence of 41.9%. Obesity is generally considered a body mass
  index (BMI) of 30 kg per m2 or greater; however, increased waist circumference (female:
  35 inches or greater; male: 40 inches or greater) may be a more accurate indicator
  of obesity, particularly in older adults. For patients who are overweight or obese,
  the history should include whether patients are taking medications that can increase
  weight and identifying comorbid conditions contributing to or resulting from obesity.
  Clinicians should also ask about previous weight-management strategies and whether
  they were effective. Initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count,
  metabolic profile, lipids, thyroid-stimulating hormone and A1C levels, and additional
  testing as needed. The Obesity Medicine Association recommends that weight management
  incorporate five pillars: behavioral counseling, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy,
  and, when appropriate, bariatric procedures. Pharmacotherapy with anti-obesity medications
  such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sympathomimetics, and others
  should be considered for any patient with a BMI of 30 kg per m2 or greater and for
  any patients who are overweight (i.e., BMI of 27 kg per m2 or greater) with metabolic
  comorbidities. Referral for bariatric surgery should be considered for patients
  who meet the criteria. Successful management requires individualized support systems
  with periodic follow-ups through each phase of treatment.'

## Conjunctivitis: Diagnosis and Management

Stella Winters, Winfred Frazier, Jacob Winters

Conjunctivitis, caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies, is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis typically present as watery discharge, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis typically presents as mucopurulent discharge. A...

## Management of Obesity: Office-Based Strategies

Michelle K. Keating, Rachel K. Woodruff, Erin M. Saner

Clinical guidelines recommend screening at least annually for obesity in all adults. Despite the importance of obesity management, less than one-half of adults meeting the criteria for overweight and obesity received weight-loss counseling between 2011 and 2018. This article...

## Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults

Amanda E. Olagunju, Faraz Ghoddusi

Adult ADHD is a continuance of childhood symptoms. Other mental disorders should be considered due to the substantial overlap of symptoms and high rate of concurrence. Clinical guidelines recommend a subset of amphetamine and methylphenidate stimulants as first-line...

## Chronic Cough: Evaluation and Management

Chronic cough is a cough lasting longer than 8 weeks in adults and 4 weeks in children. The initial assessment of chronic cough should include cost-effective diagnostic tests, such as chest radiography and spirometry, and empiric and targeted treatment for the most common...

## Mastitis: Rapid Evidence Review

Erin F. Morcomb, Carmen M. Dargel, Sydney A. Anderson

Mastitis is a spectrum of disorders resulting from inflammation in the mammary glands and is usually associated with lactation. This article provides a review of the best available patient-oriented evidence for mastitis spectrum disorders.

## Pulmonary Hypertension

Kelly Latimer, Michael Layne, Maya Payne

Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. A delayed diagnosis is common because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or lung disease.

## Continuity Matters: Financial Impact of the G2211 Code in Primary Care

Chrystal Pristell, Hoon Byun, Jeongyoung Park

Family medicine is financially undervalued compared with other medical specialties, and reimbursement fails to recognize the valuable longitudinal care provided to patients. To address continuity, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services created the G2211 code in 2019...

## Blood Pressure Control for Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy

More intensive BP control in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension decreases the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, especially among those with higher BP.

## Diagnosing Dementia and Cognitive Impairment in Symptomatic Patients

Kiyomi K. Goto, Juan Qiu, John James

Primary care physicians should not rely solely on clinical judgment when evaluating patients for dementia or cognitive impairment; however, clinical judgment may help inform the choice of additional testing to confirm or exclude the diagnoses of dementia and cognitive impairment.

## Interventions to Prevent Falls in Community-Dwelling Older Adults
