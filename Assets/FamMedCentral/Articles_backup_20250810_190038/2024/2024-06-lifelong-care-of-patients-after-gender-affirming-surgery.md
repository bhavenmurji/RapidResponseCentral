abstract: Gender-affirming surgery includes a range of procedures that help align
  a transgender or gender diverse person's body with their gender identity. As rates
  of gender-affirming surgery increase, family physicians will need to have the knowledge
  and skills to provide lifelong health care to this population. Physicians should
  conduct an anatomic survey or organ inventory with patients to determine what health
  screenings are applicable. Health care maintenance should follow accepted guidelines
  for the body parts that are present. Patients do not require routine breast cancer
  screening after mastectomy; however, because there is residual breast tissue, symptoms
  of breast cancer warrant workup. After masculinizing genital surgery, patients should
  have lifelong follow-up with a urologist familiar with gender-affirming surgery.
  If a prostate examination is indicated after vaginoplasty, it should be performed
  vaginally. If a pelvic examination is indicated after vaginoplasty, it should be
  performed with a Pederson speculum or anoscope. After gonadectomy, patients require
  hormone therapy to prevent long-term morbidity associated with hypogonadism, including
  osteoporosis. The risk of sexually transmitted infections may change after genital
  surgery depending on the tissue used for the procedure. Patients should be offered
  the same testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections as cisgender
  populations, with site-specific testing based on sexual history. If bowel tissue
  is used in vaginoplasty, vaginal bleeding may be caused by adenocarcinoma or inflammatory
  bowel disease. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):560-565.

## Abstract

Gender-affirming surgery includes a range of procedures that help align a transgender or gender diverse person's body with their gender identity. As rates of gender-affirming surgery increase, family physicians will need to have the knowledge and skills to provide lifelong health care to this population. Physicians should conduct an anatomic survey or organ inventory with patients to determine what health screenings are applicable. Health care maintenance should follow accepted guidelines for the body parts that are present. Patients do not require routine breast cancer screening after mastectomy; however, because there is residual breast tissue, symptoms of breast cancer warrant workup. After masculinizing genital surgery, patients should have lifelong follow-up with a urologist familiar with gender-affirming surgery. If a prostate examination is indicated after vaginoplasty, it should be performed vaginally. If a pelvic examination is indicated after vaginoplasty, it should be performed with a Pederson speculum or anoscope. After gonadectomy, patients require hormone therapy to prevent long-term morbidity associated with hypogonadism, including osteoporosis. The risk of sexually transmitted infections may change after genital surgery depending on the tissue used for the procedure. Patients should be offered the same testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections as cisgender populations, with site-specific testing based on sexual history. If bowel tissue is used in vaginoplasty, vaginal bleeding may be caused by adenocarcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):560-565.
