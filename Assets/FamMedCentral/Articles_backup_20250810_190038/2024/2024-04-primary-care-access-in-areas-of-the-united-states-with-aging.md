abstract: The percentage of U.S. residents 65 years and older was 17% in 2020, and this number is expected to rise due to
  the aging of the baby boomer generation.1Although life expectancy fell between 2020 and 2021, the proportion of U.S. residents
  older than 65 years continues to increase.2This age group often has more medical comorbidities and prescription medications,
  increasing the demand for primary care access. Domestic migration (U.S. residents moving within the country) of this retirement-aged
  population further strains the primary care workforce in underserved areas.

## Abstract

The percentage of U.S. residents 65 years and older was 17% in 2020, and this number is expected to rise due to the aging of the baby boomer generation.1Although life expectancy fell between 2020 and 2021, the proportion of U.S. residents older than 65 years continues to increase.2This age group often has more medical comorbidities and prescription medications, increasing the demand for primary care access. Domestic migration (U.S. residents moving within the country) of this retirement-aged population further strains the primary care workforce in underserved areas.
