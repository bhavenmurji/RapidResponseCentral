## Falls in Older Adults: Approach and Prevention

## Hyaluronic Acid Products for Chronic Wound Healing

## Saw Palmetto for the Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

Saw palmetto, alone or in combination with other phytotherapeutic agents, does not improve urologic symptoms or quality of life in the short term (3 to 6 months) or long term (12 to 17 months). Also, it does not cause significant adverse events.

## Antidepressants to Aid in Smoking Cessation

## Screening for Anxiety Disorders in Adults
