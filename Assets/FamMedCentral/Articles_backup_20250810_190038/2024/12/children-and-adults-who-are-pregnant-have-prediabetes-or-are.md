## Noninvasive Cardiac Testing

Noninvasive cardiac testing is most commonly used in the evaluation of patients with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or other symptoms suspicious for acute coronary syndrome. Clinical prediction rules can guide risk assessment for patients with acute or stable chest...

## Mildly Elevated Liver Transaminase Levels: Causes and Evaluation

Robert C. Langan, Kourtni A. Hines-Smith

Elevated transaminase levels may be associated with significant underlying liver disease and increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. Patients should be counseled about moderation or cessation of alcohol, weight loss, and avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs.

## Bone Stress Injuries: Diagnosis and Management

Jeremy D. Schroeder, Steven D. Trigg, Gerardo E. Capo Dosal

Bone stress injuries are reactions to stress fractures; they are indicated by localized pain and loss of function, most often in the setting of sudden load volume changes. Palpatory bony tenderness is the most significant examination finding.

## Management of Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars

Justin Bailey, Megan Schwehr, Alexandra Beattie

Prevention of these scars focuses on avoiding elective procedures in patients at high risk, reducing tension across the lesion, and decreasing the inflammatory response. Small keloids and most hypertrophic scars may respond well to conservative therapies, but large keloids...

## Anemia in Infants and Children: Evaluation and Treatment

Meghan F. Raleigh, Ashley S. Yano, Nathan E. Shaffer

Anemia in children is often asymptomatic. It can be caused by nutritional deficiency, genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, or infection. Universal screening in the first year of life may be considered. Treatment typically involves oral iron supplementation or consumption...

## Acute Abdominal Pain in Children: Evaluation and Management

Katie L. Buel, James Wilcox, Paul T. Mingo

Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in clinic and emergency department settings. Narrowing the differential diagnosis can be done by using the age and symptoms of the patient. History and physical examination are critical in determining which cases are...

## Protecting Continuous Coverage and Care for Children

COVID-19 federal funding tied to continuous Medicaid coverage has ended. A loss in coverage will result in children not receiving required care.

## Should Your Patients Avoid Sunscreen?

Given the growing anti-sunscreen movement and increasing rates of skin cancer, clinicians should routinely include sun protection in their prevention discussions with patients.

## SGLT-2 Inhibitors for Individuals With Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease

Michael D. North, Alexei O. DeCastro

SGLT-2 inhibitors are a valuable tool for preventing death and heart and kidney complications in patients with comorbid CKD and diabetes. Based on the evidence, we have assigned an NNT color of green (greater benefit than harm).

## Alzheimer Disease, Chronic Cough, Alopecia, Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, Cushing's Syndrome, Uncomplicated Febrile UTI

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Opioid Prescribing Has Significantly Decreased in Primary Care

Chrystal Pristell, Hoon Byun, Alison N. Huffstetler

Prescription opioids continue to be commonly used for chronic noncancer pain, despite inherent risks. Primary care physicians and advanced practice clinicians have been integral to driving change in opioid prescribing, preventing overuse, and reducing risk.

## Nonmedical Interventions to Enhance Return to Work for People With Cancer

Physical interventions improve the ability of people with cancer to return to work. Multidisciplinary training also improves the ability of people with cancer to return to work. However, neither of these types of interventions improves quality of life (QOL). Psychoeducational...

## Psychological Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease or Heart Failure

Kento Sonoda, Catherine Peony Khoo

Compared with no psychological intervention, psychological interventions are safe and effective for improving depression, anxiety, and mental health–related quality of life at 6 to 12 months in patients with coronary heart disease or heart failure.

## The Overdiagnosis of Myocardial Infarction

Andy Lazris, Alan Roth, Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering health care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

## Predicting Bleeding Risk in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Who Are Taking Direct Oral Anticoagulants

Is there an accurate tool to assess bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation when starting a direct oral anticoagulant to minimize the risk of stroke?

## Weight Loss in Patients With Overweight or Obesity and Knee Osteoarthritis

Thomas Troy, Hanh Ngo, Lauren Pham

A total body weight loss of 5.1%, or 0.24% per week, results in clinically significant improvement in pain and disability in patients with overweight or obesity and knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although weight loss improves pain caused by knee OA, there is no known minimum level...
