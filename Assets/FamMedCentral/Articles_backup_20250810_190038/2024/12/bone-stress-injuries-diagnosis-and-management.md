abstract: Bone stress injuries (BSIs) are a spectrum of overuse injuries caused by
  an accumulation of microdamage, from high physical demands on normal bone or normal
  physiologic loads on structurally compromised bone. They typically result from overuse
  in younger patients but are also caused by pathologic bone conditions, including
  relative energy deficiency in sport, which features decreased bone mineral density.
  Stress fractures, representing 20% of BSIs, are the most severe type and feature
  discernable sclerosis or fracture lines on imaging. Without treatment, they can
  progress to complete fractures. BSIs present as localized pain and loss of function,
  most often in the setting of sudden load volume changes. Palpatory bony tenderness
  is the most significant examination finding. Prevention focuses on recognition and
  optimization of modifiable risk factors, which include nutritional, lifestyle, and
  physical activity habits. Despite low sensitivity, radiography should be the initial
  imaging modality for suspected BSI. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred
  definitive study. Point-of-care ultrasonography is gaining popularity, but training
  and availability are barriers in primary care. Once a BSI is diagnosed, early intervention
  is imperative to reduce pain and promote healing. Severity of BSI (grade) and location
  (low- vs high-risk of complications) guide the management approach. Injuries in
  low-risk sites are treated conservatively, whereas fractures in high-risk sites
  warrant consultation with sports medicine or orthopedics. Femoral neck BSIs, especially
  when tension-sided, require urgent surgical consultation.

## Abstract

Bone stress injuries (BSIs) are a spectrum of overuse injuries caused by an accumulation of microdamage, from high physical demands on normal bone or normal physiologic loads on structurally compromised bone. They typically result from overuse in younger patients but are also caused by pathologic bone conditions, including relative energy deficiency in sport, which features decreased bone mineral density. Stress fractures, representing 20% of BSIs, are the most severe type and feature discernable sclerosis or fracture lines on imaging. Without treatment, they can progress to complete fractures. BSIs present as localized pain and loss of function, most often in the setting of sudden load volume changes. Palpatory bony tenderness is the most significant examination finding. Prevention focuses on recognition and optimization of modifiable risk factors, which include nutritional, lifestyle, and physical activity habits. Despite low sensitivity, radiography should be the initial imaging modality for suspected BSI. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred definitive study. Point-of-care ultrasonography is gaining popularity, but training and availability are barriers in primary care. Once a BSI is diagnosed, early intervention is imperative to reduce pain and promote healing. Severity of BSI (grade) and location (low- vs high-risk of complications) guide the management approach. Injuries in low-risk sites are treated conservatively, whereas fractures in high-risk sites warrant consultation with sports medicine or orthopedics. Femoral neck BSIs, especially when tension-sided, require urgent surgical consultation.

## Mildly Elevated Liver Transaminase Levels: Causes and Evaluation

Robert C. Langan, Kourtni A. Hines-Smith

Elevated transaminase levels may be associated with significant underlying liver disease and increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. Patients should be counseled about moderation or cessation of alcohol, weight loss, and avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs.

## Bone Stress Injuries: Diagnosis and Management

Jeremy D. Schroeder, Steven D. Trigg, Gerardo E. Capo Dosal

Bone stress injuries are reactions to stress fractures; they are indicated by localized pain and loss of function, most often in the setting of sudden load volume changes. Palpatory bony tenderness is the most significant examination finding.

Thomas Troy, Hanh Ngo, Lauren Pham

A total body weight loss of 5.1%, or 0.24% per week, results in clinically significant improvement in pain and disability in patients with overweight or obesity and knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although weight loss improves pain caused by knee OA, there is no known minimum level...
