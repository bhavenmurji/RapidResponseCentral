abstract: Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients
  who have wrist pain, especially when initial treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs and rest fail. Although corticosteroid injections can offer pain relief, possible
  risks (e.g., infection, cartilage damage, skin depigmentation) should be discussed.
  Techniques and procedures for injections vary. Studies have shown significant improvement
  in carpal tunnel syndrome severity over 12 weeks using ultrasound-guided injections
  compared with landmark-guided injections. Ganglion cyst aspiration can be helpful
  for patients with significant symptoms, although more than 50% of ganglion cysts
  may recur within a year. Corticosteroid injections of ganglion cysts do not appear
  to produce additional benefits to aspiration. Intersection syndrome is an overuse
  injury; management involves rest, adjustment of activities, use of braces, nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical or occupational therapy. For symptoms not
  improved by these methods, an ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection may be
  administered. Treatment options for a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury include
  immobilization, kinesio taping, relative rest, and analgesics; corticosteroid injection
  may relieve acute inflammatory pain. De Quervain tenosynovitis is treated conservatively
  with palpation- or ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, splinting, occupational
  therapy, and activity modification.

## Abstract

Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients who have wrist pain, especially when initial treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest fail. Although corticosteroid injections can offer pain relief, possible risks (e.g., infection, cartilage damage, skin depigmentation) should be discussed. Techniques and procedures for injections vary. Studies have shown significant improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome severity over 12 weeks using ultrasound-guided injections compared with landmark-guided injections. Ganglion cyst aspiration can be helpful for patients with significant symptoms, although more than 50% of ganglion cysts may recur within a year. Corticosteroid injections of ganglion cysts do not appear to produce additional benefits to aspiration. Intersection syndrome is an overuse injury; management involves rest, adjustment of activities, use of braces, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical or occupational therapy. For symptoms not improved by these methods, an ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection may be administered. Treatment options for a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury include immobilization, kinesio taping, relative rest, and analgesics; corticosteroid injection may relieve acute inflammatory pain. De Quervain tenosynovitis is treated conservatively with palpation- or ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, splinting, occupational therapy, and activity modification.
