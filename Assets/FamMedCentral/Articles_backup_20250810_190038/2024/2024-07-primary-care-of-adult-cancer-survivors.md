abstract: By 2040, there will be an estimated 26 million cancer survivors in the United
  States. The essential components of survivorship care are (1) surveillance for cancer
  recurrence, (2) surveillance for new primary cancers, (3) management of physical
  and psychological long-term effects of treatment, (4) prevention or mitigation of
  late treatment effects, and (5) coordination of care between the oncology team and
  primary care clinicians. Recommendations for surveillance to detect recurrence vary
  with cancer type and stage at diagnosis. Screening for new primary cancers is the
  same as for the general population. Although many cancer survivors do not undergo
  recommended surveillance or screening, family physicians can encourage and facilitate
  adherence. Family physicians should also monitor and manage the physical and psychological
  effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, such as depression, lymphedema, pain,
  and sexual dysfunction. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death for cancer
  survivors, often as a long-term effect of cancer treatments. Clinicians should counsel
  patients on cessation of tobacco and alcohol use, participation in recommended levels
  of physical activity, and adherence to optimal nutrition recommendations. Finally,
  family physicians should work with the cancer care team to coordinate the care plan
  and assure that all recommended components are achieved. Written survivorship care
  plans should be provided to cancer survivors to help them transition from active
  treatment to posttreatment monitoring. .

# Primary Care of Adult Cancer Survivors.

**Authors:** Carek, Stephen, Emerson, John F, Patel, Jatin

**Published in:** American family physician | Vol. 110, No. 1 | 2024-07-01

**Links:** [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39028780/)

## Abstract

By 2040, there will be an estimated 26 million cancer survivors in the United States. The essential components of survivorship care are (1) surveillance for cancer recurrence, (2) surveillance for new primary cancers, (3) management of physical and psychological long-term effects of treatment, (4) prevention or mitigation of late treatment effects, and (5) coordination of care between the oncology team and primary care clinicians. Recommendations for surveillance to detect recurrence vary with cancer type and stage at diagnosis. Screening for new primary cancers is the same as for the general population. Although many cancer survivors do not undergo recommended surveillance or screening, family physicians can encourage and facilitate adherence. Family physicians should also monitor and manage the physical and psychological effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, such as depression, lymphedema, pain, and sexual dysfunction. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death for cancer survivors, often as a long-term effect of cancer treatments. Clinicians should counsel patients on cessation of tobacco and alcohol use, participation in recommended levels of physical activity, and adherence to optimal nutrition recommendations. Finally, family physicians should work with the cancer care team to coordinate the care plan and assure that all recommended components are achieved. Written survivorship care plans should be provided to cancer survivors to help them transition from active treatment to posttreatment monitoring. .
