abstract: Insomnia affects 30% of the U.S. population, with 5% to 15% meeting criteria
  for chronic insomnia. It can negatively impact quality of life, decrease productivity,
  increase fatigue and drowsiness, and put patients at higher risk of developing other
  health problems. Initial treatment focuses on nonpharmacologic therapies such as
  cognitive behavior therapy, which improves negative thought patterns and behaviors
  through sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation techniques. Other nonpharmacologic
  treatments include exercise, mindfulness, and acupuncture. If these approaches are
  ineffective, pharmacologic agents may be considered. Medications such as benzodiazepines
  and Z-drugs are often prescribed for insomnia but should be avoided, if possible,
  due to short- and long-term risks associated with their use. Melatonin receptor
  agonists are safer and well tolerated but have limited effectiveness. Dual orexin
  receptor antagonists are effective in patients who have sleep maintenance insomnia
  or difficulty with sleep onset. Evidence for the use of antihistamines to treat
  insomnia is generally lacking, but doxylamine is effective for up to four weeks.

## Abstract

Insomnia affects 30% of the U.S. population, with 5% to 15% meeting criteria for chronic insomnia. It can negatively impact quality of life, decrease productivity, increase fatigue and drowsiness, and put patients at higher risk of developing other health problems. Initial treatment focuses on nonpharmacologic therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy, which improves negative thought patterns and behaviors through sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation techniques. Other nonpharmacologic treatments include exercise, mindfulness, and acupuncture. If these approaches are ineffective, pharmacologic agents may be considered. Medications such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are often prescribed for insomnia but should be avoided, if possible, due to short- and long-term risks associated with their use. Melatonin receptor agonists are safer and well tolerated but have limited effectiveness. Dual orexin receptor antagonists are effective in patients who have sleep maintenance insomnia or difficulty with sleep onset. Evidence for the use of antihistamines to treat insomnia is generally lacking, but doxylamine is effective for up to four weeks.
