abstract: Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common and bothersome symptom in people using
  hormonal contraception, and it can lead to discontinuation of reliable methods of
  contraception and unintended pregnancies. Clinicians should counsel individuals
  about the potential for abnormal bleeding at initiation of the contraceptive method.
  After considering and excluding other potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding,
  clinicians can offer treatment options specific to each hormonal contraceptive method.
  This article includes algorithms to help clinicians treat abnormal uterine bleeding
  in people using levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate,
  progestin implant, progestin-only pills, and combined hormonal contraception. For
  patients with levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, physicians should first ensure
  that the device is correctly placed within the uterus, then consider nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs as a first-line treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding;
  estradiol can be used if nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective. For
  depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate or progestin implant users, combined oral contraceptives
  or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be considered. For patients using norethindrone
  progestin-only pills, changing to drospirenone progesterone-only pills may help
  reduce the bleeding. In people using combined hormonal contraception, it may be
  helpful to increase estrogen content from 20 mcg to 35 mcg per day, decrease the
  hormone-free interval (from seven to four or five days) in people using cyclic contraception,
  or start a trial of low-dose doxycycline. For continuous combined contraception
  users, adding a hormone-free interval of four or five days can help regulate bleeding
  patterns.

## Abstract

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common and bothersome symptom in people using hormonal contraception, and it can lead to discontinuation of reliable methods of contraception and unintended pregnancies. Clinicians should counsel individuals about the potential for abnormal bleeding at initiation of the contraceptive method. After considering and excluding other potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding, clinicians can offer treatment options specific to each hormonal contraceptive method. This article includes algorithms to help clinicians treat abnormal uterine bleeding in people using levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate, progestin implant, progestin-only pills, and combined hormonal contraception. For patients with levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, physicians should first ensure that the device is correctly placed within the uterus, then consider nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a first-line treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding; estradiol can be used if nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective. For depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate or progestin implant users, combined oral contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be considered. For patients using norethindrone progestin-only pills, changing to drospirenone progesterone-only pills may help reduce the bleeding. In people using combined hormonal contraception, it may be helpful to increase estrogen content from 20 mcg to 35 mcg per day, decrease the hormone-free interval (from seven to four or five days) in people using cyclic contraception, or start a trial of low-dose doxycycline. For continuous combined contraception users, adding a hormone-free interval of four or five days can help regulate bleeding patterns.
