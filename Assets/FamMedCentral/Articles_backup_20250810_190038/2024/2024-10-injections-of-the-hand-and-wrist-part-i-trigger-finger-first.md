abstract: Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients
  who have pain due to hand and finger conditions, especially when initial treatments
  such as splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective. Corticosteroid
  injections can offer pain relief; however, potential risks such as infection, cartilage
  damage, and skin depigmentation should be discussed. Techniques and procedures for
  injections vary. Corticosteroid injections for ste-nosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger
  finger) can be performed with or without ultrasound guidance. To maximize benefits
  of corticosteroid injection for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, topical nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs and other conservative treatment modalities should be used
  concurrently. Because of the risks of disease recurrence and adverse effects, corticosteroid
  injections for palmar fibromatosis should be approached with caution in the context
  of shared decision-making.

## Abstract

Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients who have pain due to hand and finger conditions, especially when initial treatments such as splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective. Corticosteroid injections can offer pain relief; however, potential risks such as infection, cartilage damage, and skin depigmentation should be discussed. Techniques and procedures for injections vary. Corticosteroid injections for ste-nosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) can be performed with or without ultrasound guidance. To maximize benefits of corticosteroid injection for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other conservative treatment modalities should be used concurrently. Because of the risks of disease recurrence and adverse effects, corticosteroid injections for palmar fibromatosis should be approached with caution in the context of shared decision-making.
