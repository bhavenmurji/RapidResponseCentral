abstract: Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or
  more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should
  have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate
  serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological,
  environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination
  should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended
  but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or
  if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest.
  Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with
  varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation,
  massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,
  and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also
  be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines,
  muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants,
  cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections
  are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular
  pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation
  for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and
  pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated
  disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients
  present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression
  from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial
  for preventing progression.

## Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: Prevention and Treatment

Scott Bragg, Sarah Tucker Marrison, Sean Haley

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Screening patients is essential; physicians should address underlying risk factors to reduce the likelihood of developing...

## Chronic Low Back Pain in Adults: Evaluation and Management

Donald Clinton Maharty, Shaun C. Hines, Regina Bray Brown

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia...

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice

Gregory Castelli, Stacy J. Bartlett

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation and American College of Physicians.

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? No: Other Drugs Have Stronger Evidence of Benefit

Clinicians were excited when research showed that metformin reduces mortality and decreases complications associated with type 2 diabetes. However, enthusiasm has been tempered by further research that has yet to support these claims.

## Thiazide Diuretics vs. Other Antihypertensive Drug Classes

Arindam Sarkar, Katelyn D. Sarkar

There is no mortality benefit in using thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes; however, these diuretics most likely reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure compared with calcium channel blockers.
