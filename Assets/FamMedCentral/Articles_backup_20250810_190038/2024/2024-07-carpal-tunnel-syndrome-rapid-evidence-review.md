abstract: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of the median nerve
  as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Patients commonly experience pain, paresthesia,
  and, less often, weakness in the distribution of the median nerve. Provocative maneuvers,
  such as the Phalen test and Tinel sign, have varying sensitivity and specificity
  for the diagnosis of CTS. Thenar atrophy is a late finding and highly specific for
  CTS. Although patients with a classic presentation of CTS do not need additional
  testing for diagnosis, electrodiagnostic studies can confirm the diagnosis in atypical
  cases, exclude other causes, and gauge severity for surgical prognosis. An abnormal
  nerve conduction study is useful for ruling in CTS, but a normal test does not necessarily
  exclude it. Over-the-counter analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs and acetaminophen, have not shown benefit for CTS. Patients with mild to moderate
  CTS initially may be offered nonsurgical treatments, such as splinting or local
  corticosteroid injections. Night-only splinting is as effective as continuous wear.
  A neutral wrist splint may be more effective than an extension splint. In patients
  with recent onset of CTS, corticosteroid injections provide slightly greater improvement
  of symptoms compared with splinting at 6 weeks, with similar outcomes at 6 months.
  Patients with severe CTS, including objective weakness or sensory deficits, should
  be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open carpal tunnel release techniques
  are equally effective.

## Abstract

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Patients commonly experience pain, paresthesia, and, less often, weakness in the distribution of the median nerve. Provocative maneuvers, such as the Phalen test and Tinel sign, have varying sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CTS. Thenar atrophy is a late finding and highly specific for CTS. Although patients with a classic presentation of CTS do not need additional testing for diagnosis, electrodiagnostic studies can confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases, exclude other causes, and gauge severity for surgical prognosis. An abnormal nerve conduction study is useful for ruling in CTS, but a normal test does not necessarily exclude it. Over-the-counter analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen, have not shown benefit for CTS. Patients with mild to moderate CTS initially may be offered nonsurgical treatments, such as splinting or local corticosteroid injections. Night-only splinting is as effective as continuous wear. A neutral wrist splint may be more effective than an extension splint. In patients with recent onset of CTS, corticosteroid injections provide slightly greater improvement of symptoms compared with splinting at 6 weeks, with similar outcomes at 6 months. Patients with severe CTS, including objective weakness or sensory deficits, should be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open carpal tunnel release techniques are equally effective.
