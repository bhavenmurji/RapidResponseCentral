abstract: Foot fractures account for about one-third of lower extremity fractures
  in adults. They are typically caused by a crush injury or an axial or twisting force
  on the foot. Patients usually present with bony point tenderness and swelling of
  the affected area. Weight-bearing varies based on the extent of the fracture and
  the patient's pain tolerance. When a foot or toe fracture is suspected, anteroposterior,
  lateral, and oblique radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained. The Ottawa
  foot and ankle rules can help determine the need for radiography after an acute
  ankle inversion injury. Many foot fractures can be managed with a short leg cast
  or boot or a hard-soled shoe. Weight-bearing and duration of immobilization are
  based on the stability of the fracture and the patient's pain level. Most toe fractures
  can be managed nonsurgically with a hard-soled shoe for two to six weeks. Close
  attention should be paid to the great toe because of its role in weight-bearing,
  and physicians should follow specific guidelines for orthopedic referral. Meta-tarsal
  shaft fractures are managed with a boot or hard-soled shoe for three to six weeks.
  The proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal has varied rates of healing due to poor
  blood supply, and management is based on the fracture zone. Lis-franc fractures
  are often overlooked; radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained, and physicians
  should look for widening of the tarsometatarsal joint. Other tarsal bone fractures
  can be managed with a short leg cast or boot for four to six weeks when nonsurgical
  treatment is indicated. Common foot fracture complications include arthritis, infection,
  malunion or nonunion, and compartment syndrome.

## Abstract

Foot fractures account for about one-third of lower extremity fractures in adults. They are typically caused by a crush injury or an axial or twisting force on the foot. Patients usually present with bony point tenderness and swelling of the affected area. Weight-bearing varies based on the extent of the fracture and the patient's pain tolerance. When a foot or toe fracture is suspected, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules can help determine the need for radiography after an acute ankle inversion injury. Many foot fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot or a hard-soled shoe. Weight-bearing and duration of immobilization are based on the stability of the fracture and the patient's pain level. Most toe fractures can be managed nonsurgically with a hard-soled shoe for two to six weeks. Close attention should be paid to the great toe because of its role in weight-bearing, and physicians should follow specific guidelines for orthopedic referral. Meta-tarsal shaft fractures are managed with a boot or hard-soled shoe for three to six weeks. The proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal has varied rates of healing due to poor blood supply, and management is based on the fracture zone. Lis-franc fractures are often overlooked; radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained, and physicians should look for widening of the tarsometatarsal joint. Other tarsal bone fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot for four to six weeks when nonsurgical treatment is indicated. Common foot fracture complications include arthritis, infection, malunion or nonunion, and compartment syndrome.
