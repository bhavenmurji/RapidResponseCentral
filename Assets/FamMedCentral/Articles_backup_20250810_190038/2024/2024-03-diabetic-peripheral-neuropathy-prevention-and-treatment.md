abstract: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes
  mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent
  screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment
  of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk
  factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure,
  and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy
  for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline,
  and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected
  extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options
  is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine,
  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic,
  objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not
  obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects
  can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality
  evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous
  electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
  is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such
  as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA
  need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

## Abstract

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
