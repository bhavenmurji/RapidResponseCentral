abstract: Cushing's syndrome is a rare, multisystemic disease caused by chronic exposure
  to supraphysiologic levels of cortisol. Prolonged hypercortisolism is associated
  with significant multisystem morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life.
  Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is often delayed by several years due to its insidiously
  progressive course, diverse clinical presentation, overlap of symptoms with many
  common conditions, and testing complexity. Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be
  excluded as the primary etiology. Excessive endogenous cortisol production can be
  caused by an overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through pituitary
  tumors or ectopic sources (ACTH-dependent cases), or it can be caused by autonomous
  cortisol overproduction by the adrenal glands (ACTH-independent cases). The recommended
  diagnostic approach includes appropriate screening, confirmation of hypercortisolism,
  and determination of etiology. First-line treatment is surgical removal of the source
  of cortisol overproduction. Lifelong posttherapy monitoring is required to treat
  comorbidities and detect recurrence.

# Cushing's Syndrome: Rapid Evidence Review.

## Abstract

Cushing's syndrome is a rare, multisystemic disease caused by chronic exposure to supraphysiologic levels of cortisol. Prolonged hypercortisolism is associated with significant multisystem morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is often delayed by several years due to its insidiously progressive course, diverse clinical presentation, overlap of symptoms with many common conditions, and testing complexity. Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be excluded as the primary etiology. Excessive endogenous cortisol production can be caused by an overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through pituitary tumors or ectopic sources (ACTH-dependent cases), or it can be caused by autonomous cortisol overproduction by the adrenal glands (ACTH-independent cases). The recommended diagnostic approach includes appropriate screening, confirmation of hypercortisolism, and determination of etiology. First-line treatment is surgical removal of the source of cortisol overproduction. Lifelong posttherapy monitoring is required to treat comorbidities and detect recurrence.
