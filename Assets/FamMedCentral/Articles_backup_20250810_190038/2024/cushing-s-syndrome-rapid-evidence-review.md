abstract: Cushing's syndrome is a rare, multisystemic disease caused by chronic exposure
  to supraphysiologic levels of cortisol. Prolonged hypercortisolism is associated
  with significant multisystem morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life.
  Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is often delayed by several years due to its insidiously
  progressive course, diverse clinical presentation, overlap of symptoms with many
  common conditions, and testing complexity. Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be
  excluded as the primary etiology. Excessive endogenous cortisol production can be
  caused by an overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) through pituitary
  tumors or ectopic sources (ACTH-dependent cases), or it can be caused by autonomous
  cortisol overproduction by the adrenal glands (ACTH-independent cases). The recommended
  diagnostic approach includes appropriate screening, confirmation of hypercortisolism,
  and determination of etiology. First-line treatment is surgical removal of the source
  of cortisol overproduction. Lifelong posttherapy monitoring is required to treat
  comorbidities and detect recurrence.

## Introduction

Cushing's syndrome is a multifaceted and progressive disease caused by chronic exposure to excessive levels of cortisol from iatrogenic or internal sources. Exogenous (iatrogenic) Cushing's syndrome, which is caused by the administration of glucocorticoids, is the most common form and must be ruled out. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) dependent (80% to 85% of cases) or ACTH independent (15% to 20% of cases).

Most cases (75% to 80%) are caused by Cushing's disease, which features a pituitary adenoma excessively secreting ACTH. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome can also be caused by ectopic ACTH syndrome, which results from tumors that excessively produce ACTH (15% to 20% of cases) or corticotropin-releasing hormone (less than 1% of cases).

## Urinary Catheter Management

Kyle J. Fletke, Dae Hyoun Jeong, Alexander V. Herrera

The three main types of urinary catheters are external urinary devices, clean intermittent catheterization, and indwelling urinary catheterization. Family physicians often aid in initial catheter choice, provide routine care, and address complications.

## Palpitations: Evaluation, Management, and Wearable Smart Devices

Robert L. Gauer, Melanie F. Thomas, Ryan A. McNutt

The presence of palpitations is associated with a low mortality rate, but routine palpitations can impair quality of life. A detailed history, focused physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and electrocardiography are often sufficient to identify the etiology of...

## Cushing's Syndrome: Rapid Evidence Review

David L. Maness, Grant Studebaker, Christopher M. Knight

Family physicians have an important role in recognizing the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, ordering initial tests, referring patients to the appropriate specialists, and following up with patients and their families.

## Alzheimer Disease: Treatment of Cognitive and Functional Symptoms

Ecler Ercole Jaqua, Mai-Linh N. Tran, Mary Hanna

Approximately 6.9 million people in the United States 65 years and older live with Alzheimer disease, a number expected to double by 2060. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer disease, treatments are available to manage symptoms.

## Surgical vs. Nonsurgical Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Bless Jung, Jeffrey Leggit, Patient Perspective by John James

Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome probably results in some clinical improvement compared with splinting in the long term (more than 3 months), but it does not appear to lead to clinically significant improvement in symptoms or hand function. Similarly, surgery does not...
