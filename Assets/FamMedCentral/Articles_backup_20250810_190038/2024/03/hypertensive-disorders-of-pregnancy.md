abstract: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal
  morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic and gestational
  hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet
  count) syndrome, eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.
  For patients with chronic hypertension, oral antihypertensive therapy should be
  initiated or titrated at a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or greater.
  Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features can be managed
  with blood pressure monitoring, laboratory testing for disease progression, antenatal
  testing for fetal well-being, and delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. The use of antihypertensive
  drugs to control nonsevere hypertension in the setting of gestational hypertension
  and preeclampsia does not improve outcomes and is not recommended. Antihypertensive
  therapy should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset severe hypertension to
  prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Preeclampsia with severe features requires immediate
  stabilization and inpatient treatment with magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis
  and antenatal corticosteroids (if preterm). Patients in the preterm period should
  receive antenatal corticosteroids without delaying delivery to complete courses.
  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can worsen or initially present after delivery
  and account for up to 44% of pregnancy-related deaths in the first six days postpartum.
  Patients should be monitored closely in the early postpartum period. Hypertensive
  disorders of pregnancy are linked to poor long-term maternal and fetal outcomes,
  including increased maternal lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Daily low-dose
  aspirin therapy starting at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation is safe and effective for
  reducing the risk of preeclampsia for patients with risk factors.

## Abstract

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. For patients with chronic hypertension, oral antihypertensive therapy should be initiated or titrated at a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features can be managed with blood pressure monitoring, laboratory testing for disease progression, antenatal testing for fetal well-being, and delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. The use of antihypertensive drugs to control nonsevere hypertension in the setting of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia does not improve outcomes and is not recommended. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset severe hypertension to prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Preeclampsia with severe features requires immediate stabilization and inpatient treatment with magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and antenatal corticosteroids (if preterm). Patients in the preterm period should receive antenatal corticosteroids without delaying delivery to complete courses. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can worsen or initially present after delivery and account for up to 44% of pregnancy-related deaths in the first six days postpartum. Patients should be monitored closely in the early postpartum period. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are linked to poor long-term maternal and fetal outcomes, including increased maternal lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Daily low-dose aspirin therapy starting at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation is safe and effective for reducing the risk of preeclampsia for patients with risk factors.

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice

Gregory Castelli, Stacy J. Bartlett

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation and American College of Physicians.

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? No: Other Drugs Have Stronger Evidence of Benefit

Clinicians were excited when research showed that metformin reduces mortality and decreases complications associated with type 2 diabetes. However, enthusiasm has been tempered by further research that has yet to support these claims.

We chose a color recommendation of yellow (more data are needed) for this intervention in treating chronic pain.

## Thiazide Diuretics vs. Other Antihypertensive Drug Classes

Arindam Sarkar, Katelyn D. Sarkar

There is no mortality benefit in using thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes; however, these diuretics most likely reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure compared with calcium channel blockers.

## Direct Oral Anticoagulants vs. Conventional Anticoagulants for the Treatment of VTE

## Does Melatonin Prevent Hospital-Acquired Delirium?

Jacare Cardoza, Leah Foley, Yilin Zhang, Jon O. Neher, Sarah Safranek

Melatonin should not be used to prevent hospital-acquired delirium because it does not reduce the incidence, duration, or complications of delirium, including increased length of stay or mortality.
