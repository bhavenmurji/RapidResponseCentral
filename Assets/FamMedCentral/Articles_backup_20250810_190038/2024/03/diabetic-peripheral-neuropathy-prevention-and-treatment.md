abstract: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes
  mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent
  screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment
  of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk
  factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure,
  and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy
  for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline,
  and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected
  extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options
  is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine,
  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic,
  objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not
  obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects
  can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality
  evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous
  electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
  is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such
  as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA
  need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

## Abstract

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

## Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: Prevention and Treatment

Scott Bragg, Sarah Tucker Marrison, Sean Haley

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Screening patients is essential; physicians should address underlying risk factors to reduce the likelihood of developing...

## Chronic Low Back Pain in Adults: Evaluation and Management

Donald Clinton Maharty, Shaun C. Hines, Regina Bray Brown

Chronic low back pain is defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or longer. Routine imaging is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies, such as exercise and physical therapy, are first-line management. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain...

This article provides a summary and review of the best available patient-oriented evidence for pancreatic cancer.

## Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy

Narges Farahi, Fareedat Oluyadi, Andrea B. Dotson

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia...

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice

Gregory Castelli, Stacy J. Bartlett

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation and American College of Physicians.

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? No: Other Drugs Have Stronger Evidence of Benefit

Clinicians were excited when research showed that metformin reduces mortality and decreases complications associated with type 2 diabetes. However, enthusiasm has been tempered by further research that has yet to support these claims.

## Thiazide Diuretics vs. Other Antihypertensive Drug Classes

Arindam Sarkar, Katelyn D. Sarkar

There is no mortality benefit in using thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes; however, these diuretics most likely reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure compared with calcium channel blockers.

## Direct Oral Anticoagulants vs. Conventional Anticoagulants for the Treatment of VTE

## Does Melatonin Prevent Hospital-Acquired Delirium?

Jacare Cardoza, Leah Foley, Yilin Zhang, Jon O. Neher, Sarah Safranek

Melatonin should not be used to prevent hospital-acquired delirium because it does not reduce the incidence, duration, or complications of delirium, including increased length of stay or mortality.

## Fezolinetant (Veozah) for the Treatment of Menopause Symptoms

Fezolinetant is well tolerated; however, it is more expensive and less effective than hormone therapy or available nonhormonal treatments for the relief of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.
