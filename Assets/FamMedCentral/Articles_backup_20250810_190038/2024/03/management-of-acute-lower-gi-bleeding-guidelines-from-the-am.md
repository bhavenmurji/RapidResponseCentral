## Newborn Skin: Part I. Common Rashes and Skin Changes

Katherine A. M. Snyder, Adam D. Voelckers

Part I of this article reviews the presentation, prognosis, and treatment of the most common rashes and skin changes that present during the first four weeks of life.

## Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: Prevention and Treatment

Scott Bragg, Sarah Tucker Marrison, Sean Haley

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Screening patients is essential; physicians should address underlying risk factors to reduce the likelihood of developing...

## Chronic Low Back Pain in Adults: Evaluation and Management

Donald Clinton Maharty, Shaun C. Hines, Regina Bray Brown

Chronic low back pain is defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or longer. Routine imaging is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies, such as exercise and physical therapy, are first-line management. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain...

## Pancreatic Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

This article provides a summary and review of the best available patient-oriented evidence for pancreatic cancer.

## Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy

Narges Farahi, Fareedat Oluyadi, Andrea B. Dotson

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia...

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice

Gregory Castelli, Stacy J. Bartlett

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation and American College of Physicians.

## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? No: Other Drugs Have Stronger Evidence of Benefit

Clinicians were excited when research showed that metformin reduces mortality and decreases complications associated with type 2 diabetes. However, enthusiasm has been tempered by further research that has yet to support these claims.

## Pleural Effusion, Giardia, Adnexal Mass, Testosterone Replacement, Chronic Kidney Disease, Scalp Psoriasis

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Remote Delivery of Psychological Therapies May Improve Chronic Pain

D. Jason Frasca, Michael Lustig, Soquel Rey

We chose a color recommendation of yellow (more data are needed) for this intervention in treating chronic pain.

## Thiazide Diuretics vs. Other Antihypertensive Drug Classes

Arindam Sarkar, Katelyn D. Sarkar

There is no mortality benefit in using thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes; however, these diuretics most likely reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure compared with calcium channel blockers.

## Direct Oral Anticoagulants vs. Conventional Anticoagulants for the Treatment of VTE

Joseph R. Yancey, Corey J. Herman

Direct oral anticoagulants are as effective as conventional anticoagulants at preventing recurrent deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and reducing all-cause mortality. Direct oral anticoagulants slightly decrease the likelihood of major bleeding compared with...

## Screening and Preventive Interventions for Oral Health in Adults

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening or preventive interventions performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or periodontal-related disease,...

## Screening and Preventive Interventions for Oral Health in Children, Adolescents, and Adults

Sheena Harris, Susan J. Ching, Radhika Agarwal, Elizabeth Lees

This PPIP quiz is based on the recommendations of the USPSTF.

## Palpable Purpura

Richard W. Novotny, Lien N. Trinh, Amy J. Gowan, Matthew C. Lomeli

A 57-year-old woman presented with a nonpruritic rash associated with paresthesia, myalgia, and worsening joint pain.

## Avoiding Delays in Diagnosing Endometriosis

Alan R. Roth, Andy Lazris, Patient perspective by Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering heath care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

## Does Melatonin Prevent Hospital-Acquired Delirium?

Jacare Cardoza, Leah Foley, Yilin Zhang, Jon O. Neher, Sarah Safranek

Melatonin should not be used to prevent hospital-acquired delirium because it does not reduce the incidence, duration, or complications of delirium, including increased length of stay or mortality.

## Fezolinetant (Veozah) for the Treatment of Menopause Symptoms

Fezolinetant is well tolerated; however, it is more expensive and less effective than hormone therapy or available nonhormonal treatments for the relief of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

## ASCCP Management Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening

How should abnormal test results be managed in patients who have had cervical cancer screening?

## DermTech Pigmented Lesion Assay for the Detection of Melanoma

## What Physicians Need to Know About Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids

Brian K. Unwin, Julia M. D'Amora, Corinne O'Shaughnessy
