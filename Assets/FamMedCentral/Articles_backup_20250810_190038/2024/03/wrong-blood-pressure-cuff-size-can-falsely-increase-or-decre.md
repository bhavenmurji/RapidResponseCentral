## Should Metformin Continue as First-Line Pharmacotherapy for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes? No: Other Drugs Have Stronger Evidence of Benefit

Clinicians were excited when research showed that metformin reduces mortality and decreases complications associated with type 2 diabetes. However, enthusiasm has been tempered by further research that has yet to support these claims.

## Pleural Effusion, Giardia, Adnexal Mass, Testosterone Replacement, Chronic Kidney Disease, Scalp Psoriasis

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journalâ€™s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Remote Delivery of Psychological Therapies May Improve Chronic Pain

We chose a color recommendation of yellow (more data are needed) for this intervention in treating chronic pain.

## Thiazide Diuretics vs. Other Antihypertensive Drug Classes

Arindam Sarkar, Katelyn D. Sarkar

There is no mortality benefit in using thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes; however, these diuretics most likely reduce cardiovascular events and heart failure compared with calcium channel blockers.

## Direct Oral Anticoagulants vs. Conventional Anticoagulants for the Treatment of VTE

Joseph R. Yancey, Corey J. Herman

Direct oral anticoagulants are as effective as conventional anticoagulants at preventing recurrent deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and reducing all-cause mortality. Direct oral anticoagulants slightly decrease the likelihood of major bleeding compared with...

## Screening and Preventive Interventions for Oral Health in Adults

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening or preventive interventions performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or periodontal-related disease,...

## Does Melatonin Prevent Hospital-Acquired Delirium?

Jacare Cardoza, Leah Foley, Yilin Zhang, Jon O. Neher, Sarah Safranek

Melatonin should not be used to prevent hospital-acquired delirium because it does not reduce the incidence, duration, or complications of delirium, including increased length of stay or mortality.

## Fezolinetant (Veozah) for the Treatment of Menopause Symptoms
