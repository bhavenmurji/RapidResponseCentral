Kira Harris, Christopher A. Zagar, Kelley V. Lawrence

Osteoporosis affects 10.2% of adults older than 50 years and is expected to increase to 13.6% by 2030. Osteoporotic fractures, specifically hip fractures, have significant impacts on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.

## Distinguishing Asthma and COPD in Primary Care: A Case-based Approach

T. Aaron Zeller, Katherine Beben, Stephanie Walker

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect more than 40 million Americans, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult. Accurate diagnosis requires spirometry that demonstrates a characteristic pattern.

## Glaucoma: Diagnosis and Management

Glaucoma is a group of eye disorders characterized by progressive deterioration of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form in the United States.

## Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Common Questions and Answers

## Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Evaluation and Treatment

Zachary Sartor, Lance Kelley, Ryan Laschober

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur in response to a broad range of traumatic events. Psychological symptoms can be mistaken for anxiety or mood disorders, which are often comorbidities of PTSD. There are several assessment tools available to help diagnose PTSD and...

## Pulmonary Nodules: Common Questions and Answers

Robert C. Langan, Andrew J. Goodbred

Pulmonary nodules are commonly discovered incidentally on chest imaging or from dedicated lung cancer screening. Screening adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years with low-dose computed...

## Reconsidering the Use of Race in Spirometry Interpretation

An analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Lung Study found that the use of race corrections in spirometry interpretation did not help to predict chronic lower respiratory disease events any more accurately than the use of race-neutral calculations.

## Multicancer Early Detection: A Promise Yet to Be Proven

Chyke A. Doubeni, Philip E. Castle

Because of known limitations and inadequate evidence, primary care clinicians should focus on providing USPSTF-recommended, evidence-based preventive services and only use multicancer early detection tests in the context of well-designed clinical research studies and not in...

## Pneumococcal Vaccine, Polymyalgia Rheumatica, Giant Cell Arteritis, Concussion, Malaria

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Corticosteroids for Low Back Pain

We assigned a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) due to modest improvements for radicular back pain and an incomplete view of potential patient-oriented harms. The most clinically meaningful evidence to patients is the potential for corticosteroids to improve...

## Antiplatelet Agents for the Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis

Alexis Reedy-Cooper, Juan Perez

Best medical practices for the initial treatment of uncomplicated DVT include anticoagulation, compression stockings, and physical exercise. In the management of DVT, adding an antiplatelet agent to standard practices does not show clear benefits or cause significant adverse...

## Foot Orthoses for Treating Flat Feet in Children

Customized or prefabricated foot orthoses do not result in significant improvements in pain, function, or parent and child quality-of-life scores. Importantly, quality-of-life scores were not reported in patients who were asymptomatic.
