## Distinguishing Asthma and COPD in Primary Care: A Case-based Approach

T. Aaron Zeller, Katherine Beben, Stephanie Walker

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect more than 40 million Americans, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult. Accurate diagnosis requires spirometry that demonstrates a characteristic pattern.

## Glaucoma: Diagnosis and Management
