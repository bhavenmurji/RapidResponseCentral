abstract: There are benefits to having a primary care physician or a usual source
  of care. Adults with a primary care physician have higher rates of preventive care,
  have improved communication with their care team, and receive more attention to
  social needs.1-3 Yet, not all individuals have equitable access to a primary care
  physician. The overall percentage of U.S. patients who reported having a usual source
  of care declined from 84% in 2000 to 74% in 2019, with wide variations across states,
  patient race, and insurance status.
