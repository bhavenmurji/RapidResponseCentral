abstract: Fibromyalgia is a chronic, centralized pain syndrome characterized by disordered
  processing of painful stimuli. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more frequently in women
  and occurs globally, affecting 2% of people in the United States. Patients with
  fibromyalgia have diffuse chronic pain, poor sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction,
  and mood disturbances. Comorbid conditions, such as functional somatic syndromes,
  psychiatric diagnoses, and rheumatologic conditions may be present. The Fibromyalgia
  Rapid Screening Tool is a helpful screening method for patients with diffuse chronic
  pain. The American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Analgesic, Anesthetic,
  and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American
  Pain Society Pain Taxonomy diagnostic criteria can diagnose fibromyalgia. Establishing
  the diagnosis and providing education can reassure patients and decrease unnecessary
  testing. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates nonpharmacologic therapies
  and medications to address problematic symptoms is most effective. Patient education,
  exercise, and cognitive behavior therapy can improve pain and function. Duloxetine,
  milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline are potentially effective medications
  for fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have not demonstrated
  benefits for fibromyalgia and have significant limitations.

## Abstract

Fibromyalgia is a chronic, centralized pain syndrome characterized by disordered processing of painful stimuli. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more frequently in women and occurs globally, affecting 2% of people in the United States. Patients with fibromyalgia have diffuse chronic pain, poor sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances. Comorbid conditions, such as functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses, and rheumatologic conditions may be present. The Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool is a helpful screening method for patients with diffuse chronic pain. The American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society Pain Taxonomy diagnostic criteria can diagnose fibromyalgia. Establishing the diagnosis and providing education can reassure patients and decrease unnecessary testing. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates nonpharmacologic therapies and medications to address problematic symptoms is most effective. Patient education, exercise, and cognitive behavior therapy can improve pain and function. Duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline are potentially effective medications for fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have not demonstrated benefits for fibromyalgia and have significant limitations.
