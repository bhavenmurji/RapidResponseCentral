## Abstract

The prevalence of depression and the use of antidepressant medications have risen steadily in the United States over the past three decades. Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medications for U.S. adults 20 to 59 years of age. Second-generation antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators, atypical antidepressants) are first-line therapy for depression. Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavior therapy and other types of individual and group therapy, is also a first-line treatment. The combination of medication and psychotherapy is preferred for severe depression. Treatment history, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects should be considered when choosing an antidepressant medication. Although many patients use antidepressants indefinitely, few studies have examined safety and effectiveness beyond two years. There is an increased risk of relapse or recurrence of depressive symptoms when an antidepressant is discontinued, compared with continued use. Gradually tapering the dosage while concurrently providing cognitive behavior therapy can decrease this risk. High-quality evidence on antidepressant use in pregnancy is lacking. Depression and use of antidepressants are both associated with preterm birth.
