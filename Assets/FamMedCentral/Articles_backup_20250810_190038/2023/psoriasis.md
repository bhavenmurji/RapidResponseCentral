## Article Content


### Main Content


Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin and systemic disorder that affects 3.2% of the U.S. population, including 1% of children. It is an immune-mediated process triggered by an interplay of genetic, environmental, physical (e.g., skin trauma), and infectious factors. Associated comorbidities include cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Psoriasis presents in various forms, including plaque, guttate, erythrodermic, pustular, inverse, nail, and psoriatic arthritis. The most common form is plaque psoriasis, which affects 90% of adults with psoriasis. Psoriasis is diagnosed clinically based on the presence of characteristic erythematous, scaly skin plaques in typical locations, with associated history and systemic symptoms. Treatment strategies are similar for most forms of psoriasis and based on body surface area involved. Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and tazarotene are used to treat mild to moderate disease. Systemic treatment with nonbiologic and biologic agents and ultraviolet B phototherapy are used for moderate to severe disease, with the exception of apremilast, a systemic agent approved for mild psoriasis. Disease management is improved with maintaining ideal body weight, avoiding tobacco products, limiting alcohol, and practicing stress reduction techniques. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index is a tool to assess severity and monitor treatment effectiveness over time. Special consideration is needed for treatment of children and patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive.
