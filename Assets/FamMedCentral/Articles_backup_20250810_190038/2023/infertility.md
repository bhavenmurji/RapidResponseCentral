## Article Content


### Main Content


Infertility is the inability to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. Evaluation and treatment are recommended earlier than 12 months when risk factors for infertility exist, if the female partner is 35 years or older, and in the setting of nonheterosexual partnerships. A comprehensive medical history and physical examination emphasizing the thyroid, breast, and pelvic areas should be performed to help direct diagnosis and treatment. Causes of infertility in females include uterine and tubal factors, ovarian reserve, ovulatory dysfunction, obesity, and hormone-related disorders. Common male factor infertility issues include abnormal semen, hormonal disorders, and genetic abnormalities. Semen analysis is recommended for the initial assessment of the male partner. Evaluation of the female should include assessment of the uterus and fallopian tubes with ultrasonography or hysterosalpingography when indicated. Laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to evaluate for endometriosis, leiomyomas, or evidence of a previous pelvic infection. Treatment with ovulation induction agents, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, donor sperm or eggs, or surgery may be necessary. Unexplained male and female infertility can be treated with intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. Limiting alcohol intake, avoiding tobacco and illicit drug use, consuming a profertility diet, and losing weight (if obese) may improve pregnancy success rates.

Infertility is the inability to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse; more broadly, infertility describes the impairment of a person's capacity to reproduce as an individual or with their partner.1 Infertility affects between 8% and 12% of couples of reproductive age worldwide, with some variation based on geographic location.2 In the United States, 12.2% of females 15 to 49 years of age have received infertility services.3

Primary infertility is having never achieved a pregnancy. Secondary infertility is the inability to achieve a pregnancy after a previous pregnancy. Both contribute significantly to infertility worldwide.2

This article focuses on infertility in opposite-sex partners; however, same-sex couples and others in nonheterosexual partnerships also require evaluation and management of fertility issues. For this review, female and male refer to the sex assigned at birth.

Globally, 48 million couples and 186 million individuals are affected by infertility.4 The National Survey of Family Growth shows that 19.4% of currently married women in the United States who are 15 to 49 years of age have had zero births and are considered infertile, and 26% of women 15 to 49 years of age have impaired fecundity.3–5 The percentage of women with infertility is lower among those 15 to 29 years of age and increases with age. Infertility was formally designated a disease in 2009 by the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association6; however, access and cost can be substantial barriers to receiving infertility care.7

Causes of infertility are female factor, male factor, and unknown or unexplained. Female factor accounts for 35% to 50% of infertility causes, male factor accounts for 40% to 50%, and unexplained infertility may account for up to 30%.8,9

The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that the female partner's age determine the time frame for evaluation.10,11 If the female is younger than 35 years, evaluation and treatment should begin after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse. Evaluation should occur after six months if the female partner is between 35 and 40 years of age. If the female partner is older than 40 years or has any condition considered high risk for infertility (e.g., known tubal disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, previous ectopic pregnancy), immediate evaluation and treatment are recommended1,9,10,12 (Table 19,10). In the setting of nonheterosexual partnerships, immediate evaluation is also recommended.

Physicians should obtain a comprehensive medical history, including duration and types of previous infertility treatment; obstetric, menstrual, contraceptive, surgical, and sexual history; a review of systems, medications, allergies, and teratogenic exposures (retinoids, valproate, warfarin, lithium); and a family history. The physical examination should be comprehensive, emphasizing the thyroid, breast, and pelvic areas (Table 2).9,10,13 Pelvic ultrasonography and hysterosalpingography are often performed during the initial workup for infertility; however, the decision to perform imaging should be guided by history and physical examination. Imaging that focuses on pathology or modifiable conditions is more high yield than routine imaging9 (Table 39,10). Figure 1 presents an algorithm for the evaluation of infertility.9–11,14–17

Endometrial polyps, leiomyomas, uterine synechiae, and müllerian anomalies can affect fertility. Fibroids occur in up to 70% of females.18 Subserosal fibroids do not appear to affect fertility, but submucosal fibroids can reduce implantation and pregnancy rates.19 Müllerian anomalies can impair implantation and increase the risk of early pregnancy loss. Postsurgical cervical scarring and stenosis and decreased cervical mucus may affect the progression of sperm from the vagina into the uterus. However, evaluation of cervical mucus is no longer routinely used in infertility evaluation.11

Tubal factor should be strongly considered when there is a history of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, or endometriosis. These conditions may lead to tubal obstruction or impaired tubal motility, which affects the ability to pick up and transmit the oocyte or embryo.8

At the onset of puberty, the ovarian reserve has diminished to less than 10% of the initial embryonic oocyte count (from approximately 7 million to 500,000). These numbers continue decreasing over time through atresia and ovulation.12,20 The measurement of ovarian reserve is the assessment of reproductive potential as a function of the number of oocytes.10 Although variable among females of the same chronologic age, ovarian reserve correlates directly with age and diminishes in all females over time.13

There are multiple indicators of ovarian reserve (Table 4).21 Antimüllerian hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, and inhibin B are considered biomarkers of ovarian reserve. FSH, estradiol, inhibin B, and antral follicle count are cycle-dependent, whereas antimüllerian hormone is cycle-independent. Although antimüllerian hormone and FSH are indicators of ovarian reserve, they are unreliable markers of fertility in women 30 to 44 years of age without previous infertility.9,13

Primary ovarian insufficiency is the depletion or dysfunction of ovarian follicles with cessation of menses before 40 years of age. Primary ovarian insufficiency may be caused by chemotherapy (alkylating agents) or radiation (greater than 10 gray) and occurs in fragile X syndrome carriers. A person younger than 40 years with an elevated FSH level or family history of early ovarian failure should be tested for fragile X syndrome carrier mutation. Other known causes are endocrinopathies, infiltrative or infectious processes, pelvic surgery, and autoimmune disorders.22

Ovulatory dysfunction can manifest as oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, or abnormal uterine bleeding. Polycystic ovary syndrome accounts for most ovulatory infertility, but patients should be evaluated for other causes, including obesity and hypothalamic, pituitary, and thyroid disease. Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea, and polycystic appearance of ovaries on ultrasonography.9 A midluteal phase (day 21) serum progesterone level can be measured to determine ovulatory status. Progesterone levels less than 3 ng per mL (9.54 nmol per L) indicate anovulation.

Obesity affects fertility in females and males. In males, obesity is associated with reduced semen quality and impaired erectile function.23 In females, obesity affects menstrual function, ovulatory function, and oocyte morphology, which may impair fertilization and increase rates of miscarriage and obstetric complications.23,24

Thyroid disease and hyperprolactinemia are other factors that affect ovulation. Hypothyroidism causes a decrease in sex hormone–binding globulin and increased unbound testosterone and estradiol, which alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis by affecting the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone needed for normal follicular development and ovulation. Hyperthyroidism may lead to menstrual disturbances.25 Hyperprolactinemia causes anovulation by inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion.2

The evaluation of the male partner should include a history, physical examination, and semen analysis.26 The history should focus on reproductive history, presence of sexual dysfunction (e.g., impaired libido, erectile dysfunction), environmental or toxin exposure (heavy metals, pesticides), tobacco and cannabis use, childhood illness (e.g., mumps, cryptorchidism), developmental history, medication use (including exogenous testosterone use), and sexually transmitted infections14 (Table 527). The physical examination should include body mass index and penile and testicular assessment. The absence of the vas deferens on physical examination should prompt cystic fibrosis testing. A semen analysis should be obtained after two to five days of abstinence and is recommended as the first step in the evaluation of infertility in males. Semen should be collected and submitted within one hour of production. If the semen is abnormal, the timing for repeat analysis should be individualized, and referral to a urologist is recommended.15 The World Health Organization laboratory manual provides parameters for normal semen analysis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8706130/pdf/life-11-01368.pdf). If azoospermia (i.e., no sperm in the ejaculate) is noted on semen analysis, genetic testing for Y chromosome microdeletion should be performed.14

The diagnosis of unknown or unexplained infertility is made when there is an absence of an identifiable cause for infertility. The evaluation finds normal ovulatory function, a normal semen analysis, and at least one patent fallopian tube. Unexplained infertility may account for 30% of infertility cases.28

Optimal treatment of hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism, which can manifest as amenorrhea in reproductive-aged women, should result in the resumption of normal menstrual cycles and ovulation. Other concurrent etiologies of infertility can be considered if pregnancy does not occur.

Methods for ovulation induction include oral medications, clomiphene and letrozole, and exogenous gonadotropins. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that mimics a hypoestrogenic state, leading to increased FSH and the development of multiple dominant follicles.27 The initial dosage for clomiphene is 50 mg per day for five days, starting on days 2 to 5 of the menstrual cycle, and is increased to 100 mg per day. Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, should be used for five days (days 3 to 7 of the menstrual cycle). The typical dosage is 2.5 to 7.5 mg per day. If pregnancy is not achieved after six cycles, the patient should be referred to an infertility specialist.
