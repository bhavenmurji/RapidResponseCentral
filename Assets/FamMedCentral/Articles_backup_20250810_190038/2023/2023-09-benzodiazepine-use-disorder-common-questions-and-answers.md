abstract: In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a
  benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor
  did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face
  challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with
  known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant
  central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory
  loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase
  the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using
  concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary
  diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated
  with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal
  symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often
  prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin
  has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for
  patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over
  weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating
  behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing
  outcomes.

## Abstract

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.
