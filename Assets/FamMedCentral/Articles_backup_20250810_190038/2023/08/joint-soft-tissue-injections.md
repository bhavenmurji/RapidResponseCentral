## Abstract

Joint and soft tissue injections can be divided into two primary categories: diagnostic and therapeutic. Diagnostic injections facilitate a diagnosis by using a local anesthetic to identify the site of pain or through fluid aspiration for analysis. Therapeutic injections are categorized by the type of injectate and include corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, dextrose prolotherapy, and platelet-rich plasma. Diagnostic and therapeutic injections are most accurate under direct visualization. Corticosteroid injections help treat adhesive capsulitis and tenosynovitis but are not recommended for intratendinous injections. Hyaluronic acid has limited benefits for knee osteoarthritis. Dextrose prolotherapy injections treat tendinopathy and degenerative joint pain. Platelet-rich plasma injections effectively treat common extensor tendinopathy and knee arthritis; however, the evidence does not support its use for other soft tissue injuries. Preparation for injections includes patient education, consent, proper patient positioning, and obtaining the necessary supplies. Local infection, fractures, and allergy to injection substrates are contraindications to joint and soft tissue injections. Potential complications include pain, swelling, and redness. Corticosteroid injections into soft tissue may cause atrophy and depigmentation, and repeated injections can cause cartilage and tendon degeneration. Optimizing conservative, noninjection treatments, such as oral and topical analgesics, activity modification, or rehabilitation, is also important.

## Key Recommendations for Practice

### Evidence-Based Recommendations
- **Corticosteroid injections** for trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis are effective (Level B evidence)
- **Dextrose prolotherapy** is effective for common extensor tendinopathy (Level A evidence)
- **Intra-articular dextrose prolotherapy** improves pain and function in knee osteoarthritis (Level A evidence from RCTs)
- **Repeated triamcinolone injections** decrease cartilage thickness - use with caution (Level C evidence)

## Indications for Joint and Soft Tissue Injections

- Crystalloid arthropathies
- Inflammatory arthritis
- Intra-articular derangement (e.g., meniscal injury)
- Soft tissue conditions
- Masses (e.g., ganglion cysts, neuromas)
- Tendon/ligament/muscle disruption
- Tenosynovitis or tendinopathy

## Diagnostic Injections

Diagnostic injections identify which structure is generating pain when nearby structures overlap symptom patterns. Common anesthetics used include:
- Lidocaine
- Bupivacaine
- Ropivacaine (Naropin)

**Key Point**: Ultrasonography improves injection accuracy for acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon sheath, glenohumeral joint, and hip joint.

## Therapeutic Injections

### Corticosteroid Injections

#### Strong Evidence Supports Use For:
- **Adhesive capsulitis** - Most benefit in patients with <2 months of symptoms
- **De Quervain tenosynovitis** - Superior to splinting alone
- **Trigger finger** - Significantly reduces triggering frequency

#### Timing Recommendations:
- Appropriate when pain prohibits activities of daily living
- Should not be performed more frequently than every 3 months
- Associated with cartilage loss and tendon damage with repeated use

#### Suggested Dosing (Triamcinolone Acetonide):
- Acromioclavicular joint: 10-20 mg
- De Quervain tenosynovitis: 10-20 mg
- Knee joint: 20-40 mg
- Shoulder joint: 20-40 mg

### Hyaluronic Acid

#### Evidence:
- **Limited benefit** for knee osteoarthritis
- Weak recommendation from VA/DoD guidelines
- American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends against routine use
- May benefit patients with mild-moderate OA and BMI <30 kg/mÂ²

#### Timing:
- Peak response at 6-8 weeks
- Benefits diminish by 6 months
- Single or multi-dose formulations available

### Dextrose Prolotherapy

#### Effective For:
- **Common extensor tendinopathy** (lateral epicondylitis)
- **Knee osteoarthritis** - improves pain and function
- More effective in patients <45 years with <12 months of pain

#### Protocol:
- Series of at least 3 injections
- Spaced 4-8 weeks apart
- 5-25% dextrose concentration

### Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)

#### Evidence Supports:
- **Common extensor tendinopathy**
- **Knee arthritis** - superior to hyaluronic acid, saline, corticosteroids

#### Limited/No Evidence For:
- Achilles tendinopathy
- Patellar tendinopathy
- Rotator cuff tendinopathy
- Conflicting evidence for plantar fasciopathy

## Preparation

### Essential Supplies:
- Alcohol, povidone-iodine, or chlorhexidine swabs
- Appropriate gauge needles (21-27 gauge)
- Syringes
- Local anesthetic
- Therapeutic injectate
- Gloves (nonsterile acceptable)
- Ethyl chloride spray (optional)

### Patient Preparation:
- Detailed procedure overview
- Informed consent
- Proper positioning

## Contraindications

### Absolute:
- Local infection at injection site
- Fracture
- Allergy to injection substrate or anesthetics

### Relative:
- Systemic infection
- History of vasovagal reaction
- Current anticoagulation therapy

## Complications

### Immediate (3-25% of patients):
- Pain
- Swelling
- Redness
- Stiffness at injection site

### Delayed:
- **Corticosteroid-specific**:
  - Transient hyperglycemia (hours to 2 weeks)
  - Skin depigmentation and atrophy
  - Cartilage damage with repeated injections
  - Tendon damage

### Serious but Rare:
- Infection
- Plantar fascia rupture (with plantar fasciitis injections)
- Heel pad atrophy

## Indications for Referral

Consider referral for:
- Desired injectate unavailable
- Lack of training in procedure
- Image-guidance required
- Specific anatomic locations:
  - Glenohumeral joint
  - Acromioclavicular joint
  - Biceps tendon sheath
  - Femoroacetabular joint
- Nerve hydrodissections
- Failed response to initial intervention

## Clinical Pearls

1. **Rehabilitation is key** - Injections should be used with injury-specific rehabilitation
2. **Avoid intratendinous corticosteroid injections** - Risk of tendon rupture
3. **Monitor diabetic patients** - Blood glucose monitoring needed after corticosteroid injections
4. **Respect timing intervals** - Corticosteroids no more than every 3 months
5. **Consider ultrasonography** - Improves accuracy for specific joints
6. **Document thoroughly** - Include consent, technique, and patient response

## Summary

Joint and soft tissue injections serve both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in primary care. While corticosteroids remain first-line for many conditions, newer therapies like prolotherapy and PRP show promise for specific indications. Success depends on proper patient selection, technique, and integration with conservative management strategies including rehabilitation.
