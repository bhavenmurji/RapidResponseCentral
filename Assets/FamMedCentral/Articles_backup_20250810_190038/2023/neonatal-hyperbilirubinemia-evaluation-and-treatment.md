### Main Content


Neonatal jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia is common, and most cases are benign. The irreversible outcome of brain damage from kernicterus is rare (1 out of 100,000 infants) in high-income countries such as the United States, and there is increasing evidence that kernicterus occurs at much higher bilirubin levels than previously thought. However, newborns who are premature or have hemolytic diseases are at higher risk of kernicterus. It is important to evaluate all newborns for risk factors for bilirubin-related neurotoxicity, and it is reasonable to obtain screening bilirubin levels in newborns with risk factors. All newborns should be examined regularly, and bilirubin levels should be measured in those who appear jaundiced. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) revised its clinical practice guideline in 2022 and reconfirmed its recommendation for universal neonatal hyperbilirubinemia screening in newborns 35 weeks' gestational age or greater. Although universal screening is commonly performed, it increases unnecessary phototherapy use without sufficient evidence that it decreases the incidence of kernicterus. The AAP also released new nomograms for initiating phototherapy based on gestational age at birth and the presence of neurotoxicity risk factors, with higher thresholds than in previous guidelines. Phototherapy decreases the need for an exchange transfusion but has the potential for short- and long-term adverse effects, including diarrhea and increased risk of seizures. Mothers of infants who develop jaundice are also more likely to stop breastfeeding, even though discontinuation is not necessary. Phototherapy should be used only for newborns who exceed thresholds recommended by the current AAP hour-specific phototherapy nomograms.

More than two-thirds of newborns develop jaundice, the clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, and most cases are physiologic and benign.1 In healthy newborns, unconjugated bilirubin, a lipid-soluble breakdown product of heme, transiently elevates during days 2 to 5 after delivery due to the turnover of fetal erythrocytes.2 The liver conjugates the bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted via urine and stool. Bilirubin levels usually return to normal over one to three weeks without intervention or adverse effects.2,3

Several conditions increase bilirubin beyond normal physiologic levels. Pathologic causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia include metabolic conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism), conditions that increase bilirubin production (e.g., cephalohematoma), and conditions that increase enterohepatic circulation (e.g., pyloric stenosis).2 Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is uncommon, occurring in about one in 2,500 infants.4,5 Conjugated or direct bilirubin levels of 5 mg per dL (85.5 μmol per L) or greater are likely due to cholestatic causes including biliary atresia, while lesser elevations are seen in the setting of metabolic causes, hemolysis, and infections.4,6,7

Rarely, bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and can cause serious consequences. One study performed in Canada found that acute bilirubin encephalopathy occurs in approximately 1 out of 10,000 infants.8 Symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia or hypertonia, back and neck arching, irritability, and high-pitched crying.8,9 Acute bilirubin encephalopathy fully resolves in most cases but can progress to kernicterus.4,10

Kernicterus describes the irreversible, chronic effects of bilirubin toxicity.11 It occurs in approximately 1 out of 100,000 infants in high-income countries and presents as cerebral palsy, hearing loss, gaze paralysis, dental dysplasia, and developmental disability.12–14 Because of the serious and irreversible sequelae, it is important to be aware of risk factors for neurotoxicity and routinely examine newborns for jaundice.

Neurotoxicity risk factors are conditions that increase the ability of bilirubin to cross the blood-brain barrier (Table 1).1,2,4,10 Prematurity, hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are the most common risk factors.13,14 Newborns who develop neurologic sequelae of hyperbilirubinemia usually have at least two neurotoxicity risk factors.15 There is no clear correlation between bilirubin level alone and the risk of developing neurotoxicity.10,16

HDN occurs when maternal antibodies to erythrocyte antigens cross into the fetal bloodstream and attack erythrocytes. HDN most commonly occurs in the setting of blood group or Rh(D) incompatibility and is diagnosed with a positive direct antiglobulin test result.17 Obtaining ABO blood group, Rh(D) status, and anti-erythrocyte antibody screening in all pregnant patients can identify infants at risk of HDN. The incidence of HDN has decreased substantially since the introduction of Rh0(D) immune globulin. All pregnant patients who are Rh(D) negative should receive Rh0(D) immune globulin at 28 weeks' gestation to lower the risk of HDN.4

Identifying G6PD deficiency is a challenge. A family history of G6PD is helpful if present, but many affected infants will not have a family history. Universal screening for G6PD deficiency may be cost-effective in identifying infants at higher risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity.18

All newborns should be examined for jaundice and signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (Table 29) at least every 12 hours from birth until hospital discharge. It is important to recognize that jaundice may not be as apparent in infants with darker skin tones. In addition to examining the skin, the physician should assess for yellowing of mucous membranes (e.g., under the tongue) and scleral icterus.19 Jaundice in the first 24 hours of life is often a sign of hemolysis.4 However, visual assessment alone should not be used to diagnose hyperbilirubinemia. Objective measurements of bilirubin should be obtained in newborns who appear to be jaundiced or have symptoms suggestive of bilirubin toxicity.4,20,21

A newborn's racial or ethnic group should not be used to assess the risk of hyperbilirubinemia. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) previously included East Asian race as a risk factor for severe hyperbilirubinemia and Black race as a factor associated with decreased risk, their updated 2022 guideline on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia did not include race. The use of racial categories to assess hyperbilirubinemia risk has not been associated with decreased kernicterus rates and may be associated with harms.22

Total serum bilirubin (TSB) and transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) are options for objective bilirubin measurement. TcB correlates with TSB at lower levels across diverse, multi-ethnic populations; however, TcB values of 15 mg per dL (256.6 μmol per L) or greater or within 3 mg per dL (51.3 μmol per L) of the phototherapy threshold should be confirmed with a TSB measurement.3,4,13,23,24 Assessing TcB decreases the need for a blood draw by more than one-third, therefore mitigating the small risks of infection and anemia associated with blood draws and avoiding the costs of serum testing.25,26

Many laboratories report conjugated or direct bilirubin levels when performing a TSB measurement. A conjugated or direct (not total) bilirubin level of 5 mg per dL or greater is likely to represent cholestasis, and urgent consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended.4,6 However, a single mild elevation (less than 2 mg per dL [34.2 μmol per L]) of conjugated or direct bilirubin is unlikely to represent cholestasis from biliary atresia or other causes.6,7 Physicians should instead consider and evaluate for conditions that elevate conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, notably HDN and sepsis, and repeat testing in several days to two weeks if a cause is not identified. If the conjugated or direct bilirubin level continues to increase, cholestasis is more likely.

The goal of screening for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is to decrease the incidence of bilirubin toxicity while minimizing undue harm.4 However, developing evidence-based screening recommendations for use in high-income countries like the United States has been challenging because of the exceedingly low incidence of kernicterus, the primary patient-oriented outcome. No current screening test reliably identifies all newborns who will develop kernicterus.16

Universal screening for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia decreases emergency department visits for jaundice.27 In 2022, the AAP reconfirmed its recommendation for universal screening of newborns 35 weeks' gestational age or greater using TSB or TcB at 24 to 48 hours of life or before hospital discharge if occurring sooner.4 The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends universal screening during the first 72 hours of life.28

In an archived statement from 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force cites insufficient evidence that universal screening affects rates of kernicterus.16 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends measuring bilirubin only in newborns appearing jaundiced on examination.20 Screening all newborns for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, regardless of risk, increases rates of phototherapy, sometimes inappropriately. One large retrospective cohort study showed that only 56% of newborns who received phototherapy had a bilirubin level exceeding the recommended threshold from the then-current 2004 AAP guideline.29 There are also substantial costs to consider. The number needed to screen to prevent one case of kernicterus is estimated at 128,000 newborns, and the approximate cost to prevent that one case is $5.7 to $9.2 million.30,31

Despite conflicting guidelines on universal screening and limited evidence for patient-oriented outcomes, evaluating all newborns for neurotoxicity risk factors is important. It is reasonable to, at a minimum, obtain bilirubin levels in newborns at risk. Universal screening for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, as recommended by the AAP, is common in the United States and can be considered while acknowledging the risks of overtreatment.

Jaundice in newborns with HDN often presents earlier, sometimes in the first 24 hours after delivery. Newborns born to mothers who are blood group O, are Rh(D) negative, had a positive anti-erythrocyte antibody screening result during pregnancy, or have unknown results should have ABO blood group, Rh(D) status, and direct antiglobulin tests as soon as possible after birth via cord or peripheral blood. Obtaining TcB measurement six hours after delivery in newborns who have positive results on direct antiglobulin testing helps determine whether they need phototherapy within 24 hours of delivery.32 Infants with a bilirubin level of less than 3 mg per dL at six hours of life are highly unlikely to require phototherapy before 24 hours of life, whereas infants with a bilirubin level of 5.3 mg per dL [90.6 μmol per L] or higher are likely to need phototherapy and require ongoing, frequent bilirubin measurement.32 Newborns who test positive only for anti-Rh(D) antibodies and were born to mothers who received Rh0(D) immune globulin are not considered to have a positive direct antiglobulin test result.4

After assessing bilirubin levels, the difference between the measured bilirubin level and the hour-specific phototherapy threshold should be calculated to determine when to reevaluate an infant and repeat bilirubin measurements.4,33 Newborns with a smaller difference between measured bilirubin level and phototherapy threshold require more frequent follow-up. Online tools, including PediTools (https://peditools.org/bili2022) and BiliTool (https://bilitool.org), provide phototherapy thresholds, calculate the difference between measured bilirubin level and phototherapy threshold, and display recommendations. These tools have been updated to reflect the 2022 AAP guideline. Figure 1 summarizes an approach to the care of newborns with hyperbilirubinemia.4,33

Phototherapy is the first-line treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Absorbed light converts unconjugated bilirubin to lumirubin, one of its structural isomers. Lumirubin is then directly excreted via urine or stool, thereby bypassing the need for conjugation in the liver.34 Guidelines do not recommend direct or indirect sunlight as a reliable or safe treatment option.4,20

The AAP neonatal hyperbilirubinemia guideline provides hour-specific thresholds for initiation of phototherapy based on gestational age and the presence or absence of neurotoxicity risk factors.4 Newborns of younger gestational age and newborns with neurotoxicity risk factors have lower thresholds for initiating phototherapy.4 The phototherapy thresholds in the 2022 AAP guideline are modestly higher than in the 2004 guideline due to evidence that neurotoxicity occurs at bilirubin levels much higher than previously thought.1,4,10,16 The decision to start phototherapy is typically based on the TSB level.
