abstract: Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting 1 out of 12 people in the United
  States. Approximately 1 in 5 peptic ulcers is associated with Helicobacter pylori
  infection, with most of the rest due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
  use. The combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use synergistically increases
  the risk of bleeding ulcers more than sixfold. The H. pylori test-and-treat strategy
  is the mainstay of outpatient management. Patients younger than 60 years who have
  dyspepsia without alarm symptoms should be tested and, if positive, treated to eradicate
  the infection. If negative, they should be treated empirically with a proton pump
  inhibitor (PPI). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for patients 60 years
  and older with new symptoms and for anyone with alarm symptoms. Noninvasive testing
  for H. pylori using a urea breath test or stool antigen test is preferred. Bismuth
  quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy (nonbismuth quadruple therapy) is the preferred
  first-line treatment for eradication because of increasing clarithromycin resistance.
  To lower the risk of ulcers associated with long-term NSAID use, clinicians should
  consider coadministering a PPI or substituting an NSAID with less effect on gastric
  mucosa, such as celecoxib. Eradicating H. pylori in NSAID users reduces the likelihood
  of peptic ulcers by one-half. Potential risks of long-term PPI use include fractures,
  interaction with antiplatelet medications, chronic kidney disease, Clostridioides
  difficile infection, dementia, and magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 micronutrient
  deficiencies.
