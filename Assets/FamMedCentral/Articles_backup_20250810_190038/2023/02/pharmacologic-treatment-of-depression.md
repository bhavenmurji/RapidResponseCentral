### Main Content


The prevalence of depression and the use of antidepressant medications have risen steadily in the United States over the past three decades. Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medications for U.S. adults 20 to 59 years of age. Second-generation antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators, atypical antidepressants) are first-line therapy for depression. Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavior therapy and other types of individual and group therapy, is also a first-line treatment. The combination of medication and psychotherapy is preferred for severe depression. Treatment history, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects should be considered when choosing an antidepressant medication. Although many patients use antidepressants indefinitely, few studies have examined safety and effectiveness beyond two years. There is an increased risk of relapse or recurrence of depressive symptoms when an antidepressant is discontinued, compared with continued use. Gradually tapering the dosage while concurrently providing cognitive behavior therapy can decrease this risk. High-quality evidence on antidepressant use in pregnancy is lacking. Depression and use of antidepressants are both associated with preterm birth.

The use of antidepressant medications in the United States has increased fivefold since the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the late 1980s.1,2 Between 2015 and 2018, the percentage of U.S. adults who reported taking an antidepressant medication in the past 30 days was 13.2%, compared with 2.4% between 1988 and 1994.1,2

Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medications for U.S. adults 20 to 59 years of age.3 Rates of depression and suicide have increased, primarily among those younger than 25 years.4,5 The percentage of adults 18 to 25 years of age reporting a major depressive episode in the past year doubled from 8.8% in 2005 to 17% in 2020. During the same period, rates among adults 26 years and older increased only slightly from 6.2% to 7.1%.6,7

The definition of a major depressive episode is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., criteria for major depressive disorder.6,8 Five or more depressive symptoms must be present for at least two weeks, cause distress or functional impairment, and not be due to another medical or psychiatric condition. Symptoms include depressed mood, anhedonia, changes in weight or sleep patterns, fatigue, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired concentration, and recurrent thoughts of death.6,8 Clinical trials of antidepressants often use major depressive episode as an inclusion criterion. Although most patients with clinician-identified depression do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode, many are prescribed antidepressants.9

Second-generation antidepressants are the most common medications used to treat depression in the United States.10 These include SSRIs (e.g., escitalopram, paroxetine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g., duloxetine [Cymbalta], venlafaxine), serotonin modulators (e.g., nefazodone, trazodone), and atypical antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine).

Despite thousands of clinical trials, the effectiveness of antidepressants is not well established. High-quality reviews of randomized controlled studies show a statistically significant improvement in depression with use of antidepressant medications.11,12 A 2016 systematic review showed that the number needed to treat for response to treatment or remission is 9 for tricyclic antidepressants, 7 for SSRIs, and 6 for venlafaxine.11 Outcomes of other studies challenge these conclusions, with minimal difference in symptoms between placebo and antidepressants, publication bias favoring effectiveness, and pharmaceutical industry sponsorship of most clinical trials.11,13,14 A recent national survey of adults with depression revealed that those who used antidepressants had no improvement in health-related quality of life at two years of follow-up compared with those who did not use antidepressants.15

Psychotherapy (e.g., behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic therapy, supportive therapy) is also a first-line treatment for depression.16,17 The effectiveness of psychotherapy is similar to that of antidepressants in the primary care setting (relative risk [RR] = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.22).18 Evidence for cognitive behavior therapy is more robust than for other types of therapy.10 The combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be more effective than either treatment alone for moderate or severe depression and may reduce risk of relapse and recurrence.17,19,20

Guidelines from the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend against routinely offering medication for mild to moderate depression (defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of less than 16). If the patient prefers medication, SSRIs are recommended. Active monitoring, group exercise, and several types of individual and group therapy are recommended as management options. For more severe depression, a combination of individual cognitive behavior therapy and an antidepressant (SSRI or SNRI) is recommended.17

Shared decision-making should be used when choosing an initial treatment. Prior treatment and response, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects should be considered. Pharmacogenetic testing, intended to tailor therapy to an individual's genetic variants, has not shown consistent benefit in outcomes or cost-effectiveness.21

For the general adult population, treatment should start with a second-generation antidepressant or psychotherapy.10,16,17 If an antidepressant is selected, modest evidence shows that escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and amitriptyline are most effective in reducing depressive symptoms by greater than 50% at eight weeks (odds ratio = 1.19 to 1.96).12

Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported symptoms leading to antidepressant discontinuation during clinical trials. Patients taking SNRIs have a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting than those taking SSRIs.22 Other common adverse effects across drug classes include sexual adverse effects and weight gain, although these are less likely with bupropion.22,23

Despite concerns about increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia with SSRIs, a 2021 network meta-analysis demonstrated a low risk of ventricular arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death in those taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants.24 QT prolongation can occur with these drug classes; therefore, caution should be used when combining them with other medications that cause QT prolongation (e.g., antiemetics, antiarrhythmics, neuroleptics). Bupropion has the lowest risk of QT prolongation in patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Because of its side effect profile and potential for beneficial antiplatelet activity, sertraline may be preferred for those with ischemic heart disease.25

Long-term adverse effects should also be considered when prescribing antidepressants. Limited-quality evidence, including a 12-year cohort study, found a correlation between SSRI use and falls (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.39 to 1.59); fractures (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.39); and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.51).26

In a review of 21 antidepressants, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine (Trintellix) were most tolerated with less discontinuation of treatment (odds ratio = 0.43 to 0.77).12 Adverse effects associated with antidepressants are summarized in Table 1.23,27–36

The treatment of depression is often described in three phases. The acute phase of six to 12 weeks is intended to induce remission of symptoms and aid in recovery of function. The continuation phase of four to nine months is aimed at reducing relapse (return of symptoms). The maintenance phase is intended to prevent recurrence (a new episode of depression) after one year of treatment.10,37

Although up to 75% of patients discontinue antidepressant use within six months, others continue indefinitely.38 The increase in antidepressant use over the past 30 years is largely due to longer treatment duration.39 The longer patients are in the maintenance phase, the less often treatment is reviewed by their primary care physicians.40 Few studies have evaluated safety and effectiveness beyond two years.41

Whenever antidepressants are discontinued, there is an increased risk of relapse or recurrence, with the highest risk in the first six months.42–44 Compared with antidepressants, psychotherapy may have a longer duration of benefit and lower rate of relapse after discontinuation.15

U.S. guidelines do not specify a duration of treatment for antidepressants.10,16 Canadian guidelines recommend at least six months of treatment and two years or more for those at higher risk of relapse.45 Because each episode of depression adds to a patient's risk of future episodes, indefinite maintenance treatment is often recommended for patients with three or more episodes of depression.37

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., defines antidepressant discontinuation syndrome as “a set of symptoms that can occur after an abrupt cessation (or marked reduction in dose) of an antidepressant medication that was taken continuously for at least one month.”8 Effects typically manifest within two to four days and can last for several months.46 Typical symptoms can be described using the FINISH mnemonic (flulike symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, hyperarousal).47 Patients should be counseled on symptoms that may occur with abrupt cessation of treatment.48

Symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome can be difficult to distinguish from relapse and recurrence. The prevalence of these symptoms varies, but some reviews have found that 50% of patients are affected.46 Regardless of pharmacologic mechanism, the risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is higher for drugs with a shorter half-life (Table 2).49,50
