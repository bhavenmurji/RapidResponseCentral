abstract: 'Skin conditions during pregnancy fall into three categories: benign hormone-related
  changes, preexisting skin conditions, and pregnancy-specific disorders. Benign hormonal
  skin changes (e.g., hyperpigmentation, striae gravidarum, hair and nail changes,
  vascular changes) are common during pregnancy and often improve or resolve postpartum.
  Topical therapies, including tretinoin, hydroquinone, and corticosteroids, can be
  helpful in the postpartum treatment of melasma. The severity of preexisting skin
  conditions such as acne vulgaris, condylomata acuminata, herpes simplex, hidradenitis
  suppurativa, and psoriasis varies during pregnancy. Treatment options for chronic
  skin conditions during pregnancy often differ from usual practice because of safety
  concerns. Discussion of potential risks and benefits is important. Low- to midpotency
  topical corticosteroids are generally considered safe during pregnancy, whereas
  extensive use of high-potency corticosteroids may be associated with low birth weight.
  Pregnancy-specific skin conditions include atopic eruption of pregnancy, polymorphic
  eruption of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,
  and pustular psoriasis of pregnancy. Conditions that may cause adverse fetal outcomes
  and require consideration of antenatal fetal surveillance include intrahepatic cholestasis
  of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, and pustular psoriasis of pregnancy.'

## Abstract

Skin conditions during pregnancy fall into three categories: benign hormone-related changes, preexisting skin conditions, and pregnancy-specific disorders. Benign hormonal skin changes (e.g., hyperpigmentation, striae gravidarum, hair and nail changes, vascular changes) are common during pregnancy and often improve or resolve postpartum. Topical therapies, including tretinoin, hydroquinone, and corticosteroids, can be helpful in the postpartum treatment of melasma. The severity of preexisting skin conditions such as acne vulgaris, condylomata acuminata, herpes simplex, hidradenitis suppurativa, and psoriasis varies during pregnancy. Treatment options for chronic skin conditions during pregnancy often differ from usual practice because of safety concerns. Discussion of potential risks and benefits is important. Low- to midpotency topical corticosteroids are generally considered safe during pregnancy, whereas extensive use of high-potency corticosteroids may be associated with low birth weight. Pregnancy-specific skin conditions include atopic eruption of pregnancy, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and pustular psoriasis of pregnancy.
