abstract: Trigger points producing myofascial pain syndromes are common in primary
  care. Located within skeletal muscle, trigger points are taut, band-like nodules
  capable of producing pain and disability. Some evidence from clinical trials supports
  massage, physical therapy, and osteopathic manual medicine as first-line less invasive
  treatment strategies. Trigger points are often treated with injections; although
  randomized trials have found statistically significant results with trigger point
  injections, conclusions are limited by low numbers of study participants, difficulty
  in blinding, the potential for a placebo effect, and lack of posttreatment follow-up.
  No single pharmacologic agent used in trigger point injections has been proven superior
  to another, nor has any single agent been proven superior to placebo. Trigger point
  injections, therefore, should be reserved for patients whose myofascial pain has
  been refractory to other measures, and family physicians should first employ less
  invasive treatment strategies. Trigger point management is only one part of a comprehensive,
  multimodal, and team-based approach to patients with myofascial pain.

## Abstract

Trigger points producing myofascial pain syndromes are common in primary care. Located within skeletal muscle, trigger points are taut, band-like nodules capable of producing pain and disability. Some evidence from clinical trials supports massage, physical therapy, and osteopathic manual medicine as first-line less invasive treatment strategies. Trigger points are often treated with injections; although randomized trials have found statistically significant results with trigger point injections, conclusions are limited by low numbers of study participants, difficulty in blinding, the potential for a placebo effect, and lack of posttreatment follow-up. No single pharmacologic agent used in trigger point injections has been proven superior to another, nor has any single agent been proven superior to placebo. Trigger point injections, therefore, should be reserved for patients whose myofascial pain has been refractory to other measures, and family physicians should first employ less invasive treatment strategies. Trigger point management is only one part of a comprehensive, multimodal, and team-based approach to patients with myofascial pain.
