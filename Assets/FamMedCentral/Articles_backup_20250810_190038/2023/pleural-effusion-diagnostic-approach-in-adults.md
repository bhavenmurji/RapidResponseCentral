abstract: Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each
  year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from
  common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of
  pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary
  embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation.
  Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis,
  or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis.
  In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion)
  may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care
  ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest
  radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large
  pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features
  that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space)
  and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because
  it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes
  of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic
  thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from
  transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell
  count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and
  pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis
  testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common
  cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic
  effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible
  tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant
  effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions
  having a poor prognosis.

### Main Content


Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.
