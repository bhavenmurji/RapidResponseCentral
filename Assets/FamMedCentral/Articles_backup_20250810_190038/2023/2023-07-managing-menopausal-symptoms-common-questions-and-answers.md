abstract: Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life.
  Common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats)
  and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary
  problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood,
  and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor
  symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin
  reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin.
  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking
  tamoxifen. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term
  reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are
  lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such as
  herbal or botanicalsupplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free vaginal
  moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary
  syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia
  associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone.
  Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is
  informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

# Managing Menopausal Symptoms: Common Questions and Answers.

## Abstract

Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such as herbal or botanicalsupplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.
