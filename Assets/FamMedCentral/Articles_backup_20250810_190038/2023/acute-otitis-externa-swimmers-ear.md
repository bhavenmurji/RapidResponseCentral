### Main Content


Patient information: See related handout on acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear), written by the authors of this article.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

Acute otitis externa, also known as swimmer's ear, is an inflammatory condition affecting the external ear canal that is a common problem encountered in primary care offices. This article provides a brief update and summary of the best available patient-oriented evidence for treating acute otitis externa.

Acute otitis externa occurs in all age groups. An estimated 10% of people will develop acute otitis externa during their lifetime.1 Younger age groups are most commonly affected, with decreased incidence as one ages (Table 12).

Risk factors for acute otitis externa are summarized in Table 2,4 with the most common factor being swimming.4,5

The clinical diagnosis of acute otitis externa is based on symptoms of inflammation in the ear canal. Criteria proposed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery to aid in diagnosis are listed in Table 3.5 Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate the redness and edema of the canal seen with acute otitis externa.4

The most common symptom is pain in the tragus, pinna, or both,6 which is disproportionate to what is expected on visual inspection.5 Other causes that may be included in the differential diagnosis of ear canal inflammation are listed in Table 4.4

Physicians should review the presenting symptom onset and exposure to water (e.g., swimming) as well as any trauma to the canal and history of other skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or seborrhea. Additional history should include prior surgeries, radiation therapy, or history of systemic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, or conditions that may predispose to immune suppression.

The pinna, tragus, ear canal, and regional lymph nodes should be examined. Use of pneumatic otoscopy is recommended to help differentiate acute otitis externa from otitis media and to assist in determining that the tympanic membrane is intact without perforation because these determinations have implications for treatment options.4 If a perforation has occurred, the medications that can be used topically are limited.

Cultures of otorrhea are usually not performed because most cases of acute otitis externa are caused by bacterial infection,7 predominantly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus.

Per 2014 guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery,5 which were endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and reaffirmed in 2019,8 treatment for acute otitis externa should include an assessment of pain. Using analgesics as a mainstay of therapy to help in the management of acute otitis externa allows for increased comfort and more rapid return to normal activities.9 Figure 3 presents an algorithm for treatment.5

Analgesics that can provide relief include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or, in rare cases, the addition of a short-term opioid. Based on expert opinion, fixed dosing intervals are recommended rather than as-needed dosing.9

Available topical analgesics are limited to over-the-counter homeopathic medications for which there is no evidence of benefit. The use of otic benzocaine with or without antipyrine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2015.10 Concerns with the use of topical analgesics include the potential dilution of antibiotic drops and unknown ototoxicity if there is a perforated tympanic membrane.

The mainstay of treatment is topical antimicrobials with or without topical corticosteroids. The effectiveness of topical medications has been confirmed using meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.5,11,12 There are no significant clinical outcome differences between the drug classes, quinolone vs. nonquinolone antibiotics, or preparations with or without corticosteroids.5,11,12

Topical agents are available in a variety of combinations; regardless of which agent is used, 65% to 90% of patients had a clinical resolution of symptoms within seven to 10 days.12 A systematic review from 2010 looked at 26 topical agent combinations and came to the same conclusion.11

Cost and patient adherence play a significant role in the selection of which agent to choose. Table 5 lists some common topical antimicrobial preparations.4,5

If a perforation or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane has occurred, topical medications that are potentially ototoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, isopropyl alcohol) should not be used; a low pH medication is recommended.13 The only topical agents approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the middle ear are quinolones.5 There is an explicit warning from the manufacturer of neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone (Cortisporin) to not use in non-intact tympanic membranes.5,14

Oral antibiotics should not be used in most patients with acute otitis externa.5 Nonetheless, 20% to 40% of patients with acute otitis externa are prescribed oral antibiotics, often in addition to topical therapies.5 Many of these chosen oral antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate) lacked effectiveness against the most common pathogenic bacteria (i.e., P. aeruginosa, S. aureus). Topical therapy delivers higher concentrations of antimicrobials than can be achieved orally 5 and avoids the risk of developing bacterial resistance.13,15

Oral antibiotics should be reserved for patients who have infections that spread beyond the ear canal, those with immunocompromise or uncontrolled diabetes, and those unable to administer topical preparations.5,12,13 A referral to an otolaryngologist may be needed for these patients. Figure 4 demonstrates spread beyond the ear canal.

Patient education on how to administer topical drops is important. See a patient education handout on acute otitis externa, which provides detailed information about how to properly administer topical drops, for more information.
