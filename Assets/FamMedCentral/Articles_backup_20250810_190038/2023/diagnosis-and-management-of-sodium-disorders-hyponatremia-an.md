abstract: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia
  is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe
  when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits.
  Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain
  herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency
  infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of
  sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's
  hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include
  certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise.
  Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic
  hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption
  or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying
  cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild
  hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however,
  other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting
  the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic
  fluid replacement is necessary.

## Abstract

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.
