abstract: 'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting
  women of childbearing age. Its complex pathophysiology includes genetic and environmental
  factors that contribute to insulin resistance in patients with this disease. The
  diagnosis of PCOS is primarily clinical, based on the presence of at least two of
  the three Rotterdam criteria: oligoanovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic
  ovaries on ultrasonography. PCOS is often associated with hirsutism, acne, anovulatory
  menstruation, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and increased risk of cardiovascular
  disease and hormone-sensitive malignancies (e.g., at least a twofold increased risk
  of endometrial cancer). Lifestyle modification, including caloric restriction and
  increased physical activity, is the foundation of therapy. Subsequent management
  decisions depend on the patient''s desire for pregnancy. In patients who do not
  want to become pregnant, oral contraceptives are first-line therapy for menstrual
  irregularities and dermatologic complications such as hirsutism and acne. Antiandrogens
  such as spironolactone are often added to oral contraceptives as second-line agents.
  In patients who want to become pregnant, first-line therapy is letrozole for ovulation
  induction. Metformin added to lifestyle management is first-line therapy for patients
  with metabolic complications such as insulin resistance. Patients with PCOS are
  at increased risk of depression and obstructive sleep apnea, and screening is recommended.'

## Abstract

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women of childbearing age. Its complex pathophysiology includes genetic and environmental factors that contribute to insulin resistance in patients with this disease. The diagnosis of PCOS is primarily clinical, based on the presence of at least two of the three Rotterdam criteria: oligoanovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. PCOS is often associated with hirsutism, acne, anovulatory menstruation, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hormone-sensitive malignancies (e.g., at least a twofold increased risk of endometrial cancer). Lifestyle modification, including caloric restriction and increased physical activity, is the foundation of therapy. Subsequent management decisions depend on the patient's desire for pregnancy. In patients who do not want to become pregnant, oral contraceptives are first-line therapy for menstrual irregularities and dermatologic complications such as hirsutism and acne. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone are often added to oral contraceptives as second-line agents. In patients who want to become pregnant, first-line therapy is letrozole for ovulation induction. Metformin added to lifestyle management is first-line therapy for patients with metabolic complications such as insulin resistance. Patients with PCOS are at increased risk of depression and obstructive sleep apnea, and screening is recommended.
