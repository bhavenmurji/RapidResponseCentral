### Main Content


Pressure injuries are localized damage to skin or soft tissue. They commonly occur over bony prominences and often present as an intact or open wound. Pressure injuries are common and costly, and they significantly impact patient quality of life. Comprehensive skin assessments are crucial for evaluating pressure injuries. Staging of pressure injuries should follow the updated staging system of the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel. Risk assessments allow for appropriate prevention and care planning, and physicians should use a structured, repeatable approach. Prevention of pressure injuries focuses on assessing and optimizing nutritional status, repositioning the patient, and providing appropriate support surfaces. Treatment involves pressure off-loading, nutritional optimization, appropriate bandage selection, and wound site management. Pressure injuries and surrounding areas should be cleaned, with additional debridement of devitalized tissue and biofilm if necessary. All injuries should be monitored for local infection, biofilms, and osteomyelitis. Appropriate wound dressings should be selected based on injury stage and the quality and volume of exudate.

Pressure injuries are focal damage to skin, underlying tissue, or mucous membranes resulting from pressure that is intense, prolonged, or both. The combination of pressure and shear forces can also cause pressure injuries.1 Bony prominences are common sites for pressure injuries. These injuries can also be related to medical devices or other objects that come in contact with the patient's skin. The term pressure injury is recommended, although these injuries are also known as pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers, pressure sores, or bed sores.1–3

More than 3 million pressure injuries are treated in the United States each year.4,5 Stage 1 and 2 pressure injuries are most prevalent.6 Longitudinal studies have shown a decline in the incidence of pressure injuries over the past two decades, which could be related to increased clinical attention or changes in definitions or populations.7 Hospital-associated pressure injuries are estimated to cost the U.S. health care system $26.8 billion annually, with costs disproportionately associated with more advanced stages of injury.8

Staging of a pressure injury should use the updated National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) staging system (Figure 1).9 Notable changes from previous iterations include limiting the use of the term ulcer to only injuries featuring breaks in the skin and expanding injury types to include those caused by medical or other devices.3 Medical device–related pressure injuries result from a device in direct contact with a patient. It is important to consider the contributory device, but the injury should also be defined by the staging system.1 Pressure injuries can occur on mucosal linings of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, or genitourinary tracts. Due to the locations of these injuries, they cannot be staged.3

Assessing for risk factors is crucial to ensure appropriate prevention and plan of care. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and those developed jointly by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), NPIAP, and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (PPPIA) recommend a comprehensive clinical assessment for any risk factors central to the pathophysiology of pressure injury development, such as sensory loss, malnutrition, inactivity, immobility, and reduced perfusion.1,10

The risk assessment should focus on factors that influence the magnitude, type, and duration of pressure, as well as patient-specific factors that impact individual tolerance and susceptibility to injury 1,11 (Table 11,12,13). Reduced activity (ability to complete activities of daily living) and mobility (ability to change or control physical position) increase mechanical load and are consistently associated with the development of pressure injuries.1,12

Preexisting pressure injuries, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease, and impaired circulation can further increase risk. Increased moisture from urine, stool, and sweat can cause skin maceration and escalate the risk of pressure injuries. The patient's external environment, such as hard surfaces on prostheses, shear forces from wheelchair use, or uneven sleeping surfaces, can further compound risk.

Particular attention should be placed on populations at higher risk of pressure injuries, including people who are critically ill; individuals with spinal cord injuries or other immobility conditions; people receiving palliative care; acutely ill and immobilized neonates and children; people with obesity; people in the preoperative period; and people in the community receiving care for advanced age or requiring facility rehabilitation services due to mobility limitations.1,10,14,15

A comprehensive skin assessment is critical for patients at higher risk of pressure injuries and should be completed immediately at inpatient admission and then periodically depending on illness acuity or change in the patient's condition. The assessment should focus on areas overlying bony prominences or in contact with medical devices, especially breathing devices, tubes, splints, intravenous catheters, and cervical support collars.1,16

This assessment should note skin integrity, blanchable or nonblanchable erythema, firmness, moisture, any pain or discomfort, and variations in heat.10 If an injury is identified, documentation should include injury onset, progression, base qualities, presence of drainage or odor, prior treatments, and measurements such as depth. Images of injuries can be added to the electronic health record for initial documentation and assessment of injury progression.

Clinical guidelines recommend a structured, repeatable approach to evaluating risk of pressure injuries in conjunction with a comprehensive skin examination and clinical judgment.1,10,17 Risk assessment tools such as the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10038/braden-score-pressure-ulcers) and the Norton Scale (https://www.ahrq.gov/patient-safety/settings/hospital/resource/pressureulcer/tool) are often used.18,19 Although many algorithms have been validated, their sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients at risk of pressure injuries are low.4,17 Despite the prevalent use of risk assessment tools, there is no evidence of reduced pressure injuries associated with any scale.4,20 EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA guidelines and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality best practices recommend an initial assessment on hospital admission, with reassessments depending on illness acuity and the specific care setting, although a paucity of evidence limits specific recommendations.1,21

Interventions to prevent pressure injuries should be initiated for patients at elevated risk. The EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA guidelines recommend implementing a skin care regimen to keep the skin hydrated and clean (particularly following incontinence events), using moisture barriers, and avoiding alkaline soaps and cleansers (e.g., standard hospital soap with a pH of 9.5 to 10.5) in favor of a balanced cleanser with a pH of 5.5.1,22,23

Nutritional assessment and support are also important in pressure injury prevention. Weight loss can increase the risk of pressure injuries.24 Nutritional screening tools and assessments (including the Nutrition Risk Screening Tool [https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/4012/nutrition-risk-screening-2002-nrs-2002] and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool [https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10190/malnutrition-universal-screening-tool-must]) can identify individuals at risk of malnutrition and assist in developing a plan to optimize calorie and protein intake. However, use of nutritional screening tools has limited effectiveness in preventing pressure injuries.4,25 Additional information on nutritional support therapy is available in a previous issue of American Family Physician (AFP).26

Additionally, repositioning and mobilization plans should be individualized to each patient. Changes in weight, body habitus, or functional status require appropriate modifications in the use of beds, chairs, or prostheses. Individuals at risk of pressure injuries should be encouraged to change positions often, with assistance if necessary.10 The frequency of positional changes should be guided by clinical judgment and individualized to the patient's activity and mobility levels.1 Auditory or visual reminders can be used to increase adherence to repositioning schedules.1 The EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA guidelines recommend early mobilization, angling wheel-chair seats to reduce sliding, using manual handling techniques or equipment for repositioning to limit shear forces, and making the head of the patient's bed as level as possible.1

Support surfaces can be static or dynamic. Static surfaces, such as standard hospital foam mattresses and hospital pillows, do not provide intermittent off-loading.1 High-specification foam mattresses and medical-grade sheepskin surfaces are more beneficial than regular foam mattresses.10,27 Foam mattress surfaces may increase the incidence of pressure injury compared with alternating pressure or reactive air surfaces and may be less cost-effective.28 Advanced static mattresses or overlays, made of materials such as gel-infused memory foam, should be used for patients with increased risk.17 Dynamic surfaces, such as alternating pressure mattresses, can off-load high pressure areas without caregiver engagement. However, evidence on the surfaces used to prevent injuries is mixed and insufficient to support clear recommendations.29

Ensuring appropriate caregiver and family education on preventive measures is important to improve caregiver comfort and understanding, although existing data indicate that educational programs do not have a significant effect on preventing pressure injuries.30

Following identification of a pressure injury, a comprehensive examination (including social and medical history) should be performed. The physical examination should document the location and size of the injury; associated pain; presence of exudate, sloughing, undermining, or tunneling; wound bed color; and integrity of the surrounding skin.31 The etiology of pressure injuries is multifactorial and often coincides with complicated systemic comorbidities; thus, effective management involves an interdisciplinary team that includes caregivers.

It is critical to regularly evaluate healing progression, status of dressings and surrounding skin, adequacy of pain control, and presence of potential complications. Healing assessment tools, including the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing; DESIGN-R (depth, exudates, size, inflammation/infection, granulation, necrosis, rating) tool; and Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool can be used to monitor healing.1

Management of pressure injuries involves pressure off-loading, nutritional optimization, and wound site management (Figure 2).1,13 Wound site management includes debridement, skin care, control of microbial virulence and burden, and bandage selection (Table 2).1,32 Smoking cessation should be facilitated, if applicable. Treatment plans should account for the psychosocial trauma that pressure injuries may cause patients and caregivers. Provision of psychosocial support can improve adherence to treatment plans.33 Caregiver education may be beneficial for identifying changes in the wound and associated pain. Pain should be adequately addressed, especially during wound cleaning, debridement, repositioning, and dressing changes.1

Although data are limited, expert opinion recommends use of nonpharmacologic interventions to address pain. Examples include educating patients and caregivers about expectations during repositioning or bedside procedures; addressing psychosocial stress; and using heat, progressive relaxation, and centering and music therapies.1 Smaller studies have shown that topical opioid analgesics can also be used to manage pressure injury pain.1,34,35 Pharmacologic strategies to manage acute pain were discussed previously in AFP.36
