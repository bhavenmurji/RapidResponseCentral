abstract: 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects
  the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, integumentary, musculoskeletal,
  neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and reproductive systems. It is a chronic disease
  and may cause recurrent flare-ups without adequate treatment. The newest clinical
  criteria proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of
  Rheumatology in 2019 include an obligatory entry criterion of a positive antinuclear
  antibody titer of 1: 80 or greater. Management of SLE is directed at complete remission
  or low disease activity, minimizing the use of glucocorticoids, preventing flare-ups,
  and improving quality of life. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients
  with SLE to prevent flare-ups, organ damage, and thrombosis and increase long-term
  survival. Pregnant patients with SLE have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions,
  stillbirths, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Preconception counseling
  regarding risks, planning the timing of pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach
  play a major role in the management of SLE in patients contemplating pregnancy.
  All patients with SLE should receive ongoing education, counseling, and support.
  Those with mild SLE can be monitored by a primary care physician in conjunction
  with rheumatology. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse
  effects from treatment should be managed by a rheumatologist.'

## Abstract

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and reproductive systems. It is a chronic disease and may cause recurrent flare-ups without adequate treatment. The newest clinical criteria proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology in 2019 include an obligatory entry criterion of a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1: 80 or greater. Management of SLE is directed at complete remission or low disease activity, minimizing the use of glucocorticoids, preventing flare-ups, and improving quality of life. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with SLE to prevent flare-ups, organ damage, and thrombosis and increase long-term survival. Pregnant patients with SLE have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Preconception counseling regarding risks, planning the timing of pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach play a major role in the management of SLE in patients contemplating pregnancy. All patients with SLE should receive ongoing education, counseling, and support. Those with mild SLE can be monitored by a primary care physician in conjunction with rheumatology. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be managed by a rheumatologist.
