abstract: Disorders of smell and taste are reported by approximately one-fifth of
  people 40 years and older, and one-third of people 80 years and older. These disorders
  affect quality of life and the ability to identify smoke and toxins. Smell and taste
  disorders can be early signs of dementia or Parkinson disease and are associated
  with increased mortality. Dysfunction may be apparent or may develop insidiously.
  Screening questionnaires are available, but many patients are unaware of their disorder.
  Most smell and taste disorders are due to sinonasal disease but also could be caused
  by smoking, medications, head trauma, neurodegenerative disease, alcohol dependence,
  or less common conditions. The differential diagnosis should guide the evaluation
  and include anterior rhinoscopy and an examination of the oral cavity, head, and
  cranial nerves. Further investigation is often unnecessary, but nasal endoscopy
  and computed tomography of the sinuses may be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging
  of the head with contrast should be performed if there is an abnormal neurologic
  examination finding or if trauma or a tumor is suspected. Olfactory testing is indicated
  in refractory cases or for patients with poor quality of life and disease associated
  with smell or taste dysfunction. Smell and taste disorders may resolve when reversible
  causes are treated, but improvement is less likely when they are due to trauma,
  age, or neurodegenerative disease. Olfactory training is a self-administered mindful
  exposure therapy that may improve olfactory function. Physicians should encourage
  patients to ensure that smoke and other alarms are operational and to adhere to
  food expiration dates.
