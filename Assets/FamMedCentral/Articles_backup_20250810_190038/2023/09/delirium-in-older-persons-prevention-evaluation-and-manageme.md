abstract: 'Delirium is an acute disturbance in attention, cognition, and awareness
  that fluctuates over time. Delirium is characterized by three subtypes: hyperactive,
  hypoactive, and mixed. It occurs in 11% to 25% of older adults in inpatient settings
  and is associated with a significant financial burden. Older age, multiple comorbidities,
  recent surgery, and polypharmacy are independent risk factors for delirium. The
  diagnosis is clinical but can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms with dementia
  and depression. The Confusion Assessment Method is a screening tool that is 94%
  to 100% sensitive haloperidol because of their faster onset of action and fewer
  adverse effects. Patients hospitalized with prolonged delirium have approximately
  three times the chance of dying in the following year compared with patients with
  a quick resolution of delirium or no symptoms; therefore, prevention and early detection
  should be emphasized.'

# Delirium in Older Persons: Prevention, Evaluation, and Management.

**Authors:** Jaqua, Ecler Ercole, Nguyen, Van Tuong Ngoc, Chin, Elysia

## Abstract

Delirium is an acute disturbance in attention, cognition, and awareness that fluctuates over time. Delirium is characterized by three subtypes: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed. It occurs in 11% to 25% of older adults in inpatient settings and is associated with a significant financial burden. Older age, multiple comorbidities, recent surgery, and polypharmacy are independent risk factors for delirium. The diagnosis is clinical but can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms with dementia and depression. The Confusion Assessment Method is a screening tool that is 94% to 100% sensitive haloperidol because of their faster onset of action and fewer adverse effects. Patients hospitalized with prolonged delirium have approximately three times the chance of dying in the following year compared with patients with a quick resolution of delirium or no symptoms; therefore, prevention and early detection should be emphasized.
