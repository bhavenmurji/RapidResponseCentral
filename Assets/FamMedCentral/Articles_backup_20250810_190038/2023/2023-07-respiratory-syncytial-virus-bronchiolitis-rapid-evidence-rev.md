abstract: Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in young
  children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis.
  RSV is spread through respiratory droplets, and the number of cases varies with
  season. For most patients, standard precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, surface cleaning,
  avoiding contact with sick individuals) are recommended. However, prophylaxis with
  palivizumab may be considered for infants at high risk. Initial symptoms occur after
  an incubation period of four to six days and include rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing,
  and fever. Signs of lower respiratory tract involvement may follow and include cough,
  tachypnea, retractions, difficulty feeding, and accessory muscle use. Diagnosis
  is typically clinical; routine use of radiography or viral testing is not recommended.
  Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Oxygen saturation should be
  maintained above 90%. Hydration and nutrition should be maintained by nasogastric
  or intravenous routes, if needed. Therapies such as bronchodilators, epinephrine,
  nebulized hypertonic saline, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy
  are not recommended. Although most episodes of RSV bronchiolitis are self-limited,
  some children have an increased risk of asthma later in life.

# Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis: Rapid Evidence Review.

## Abstract

Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in young children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis. RSV is spread through respiratory droplets, and the number of cases varies with season. For most patients, standard precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, surface cleaning, avoiding contact with sick individuals) are recommended. However, prophylaxis with palivizumab may be considered for infants at high risk. Initial symptoms occur after an incubation period of four to six days and include rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, and fever. Signs of lower respiratory tract involvement may follow and include cough, tachypnea, retractions, difficulty feeding, and accessory muscle use. Diagnosis is typically clinical; routine use of radiography or viral testing is not recommended. Treatment of RSV bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 90%. Hydration and nutrition should be maintained by nasogastric or intravenous routes, if needed. Therapies such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulized hypertonic saline, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy are not recommended. Although most episodes of RSV bronchiolitis are self-limited, some children have an increased risk of asthma later in life.
