abstract: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated
  with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration
  is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less
  than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache,
  and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium,
  confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation
  and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe
  symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators
  to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration,
  which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause
  of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed
  while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive
  alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during
  exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient
  is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated
  with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting
  free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic
  hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart
  failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than
  hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an
  impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such
  as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying
  etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients
  are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement
  is necessary.

## Abstract

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.
