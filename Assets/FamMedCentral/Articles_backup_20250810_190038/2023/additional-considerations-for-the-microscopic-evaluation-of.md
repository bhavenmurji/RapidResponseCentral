## Reconsidering the Use of Race in Spirometry Interpretation

An analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Lung Study found that the use of race corrections in spirometry interpretation did not help to predict chronic lower respiratory disease events any more accurately than the use of race-neutral calculations.

## Multicancer Early Detection: A Promise Yet to Be Proven

Chyke A. Doubeni, Philip E. Castle

Because of known limitations and inadequate evidence, primary care clinicians should focus on providing USPSTF-recommended, evidence-based preventive services and only use multicancer early detection tests in the context of well-designed clinical research studies and not in...

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Corticosteroids for Low Back Pain

We assigned a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) due to modest improvements for radicular back pain and an incomplete view of potential patient-oriented harms. The most clinically meaningful evidence to patients is the potential for corticosteroids to improve...

## Antiplatelet Agents for the Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis

Alexis Reedy-Cooper, Juan Perez

Best medical practices for the initial treatment of uncomplicated DVT include anticoagulation, compression stockings, and physical exercise. In the management of DVT, adding an antiplatelet agent to standard practices does not show clear benefits or cause significant adverse...

## Foot Orthoses for Treating Flat Feet in Children

Customized or prefabricated foot orthoses do not result in significant improvements in pain, function, or parent and child quality-of-life scores. Importantly, quality-of-life scores were not reported in patients who were asymptomatic.

## Is There Evidence of ADHD Overdiagnosis in Children?

Elizabeth Wolf, Neil Sonenklar, Matthew Schefft, Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering heath care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for obstructive sleep apnea in the general adult population.

## Screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults

Justin Mills, Michael C. Harding

This PPIP quiz is based on the recommendations of the USPSTF.

## Dry Needling for Low Back Pain

Roxanne Radi, Wesley Ng, Raeanna Simcoe, Corey Lyon, Kristen DeSanto

A comprehensive treatment program that includes dry needling may provide some benefit in decreasing pain scores and perceived disability vs. standard physical therapy and home physical therapy in the short term. However, this improvement is small, and the clinical...

## Diagnosing Appendicitis in Children and Adolescents With Abdominal Pain

In children and adolescents with lower abdominal pain, is there a way to identify low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups for suspected appendicitis?

## Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) for Assessing Likelihood of Ovarian Cancer

Family physicians encounter patients with adnexal masses who require surgery, some of whom may have ovarian cancer. The ROMA test can assess the presurgical likelihood of malignancy in patients who already have a planned surgery.
