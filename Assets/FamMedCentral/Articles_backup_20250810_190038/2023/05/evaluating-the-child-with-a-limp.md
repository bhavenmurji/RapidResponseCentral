abstract: A limp is a deviation from normal gait pattern, with pain as the presenting
  feature in about 80% of cases. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes
  congenital/developmental, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic (including nonaccidental),
  and, less commonly, neoplastic etiologies. Transient synovitis of the hip is the
  cause of a limp in the absence of trauma in 80% to 85% of children. It can be differentiated
  from septic arthritis of the hip by the absence of fever or ill-appearance and with
  laboratory testing that shows normal or only mildly elevated inflammatory markers
  and white blood cell count. If septic arthritis is suspected, joint aspiration should
  be performed urgently with ultrasound guidance and the aspirated fluid sent for
  Gram staining, culture, and cell count. Patient history, such as breech presentation
  at birth, and a leg-length discrepancy on physical examination may suggest developmental
  dysplasia of the hip. Pain reported primarily at night can occur with neoplasms.
  Hip pain in an adolescent who is overweight or has obesity may suggest slipped capital
  femoral epiphysis. Knee pain in an active adolescent may suggest Osgood-Schlatter
  disease. Radiography shows the degenerative femoral head changes in Legg-Calvé-Perthes
  disease. Abnormalities in bone marrow shown on magnetic resonance imaging indicate
  septic arthritis. A complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation
  rate, and C-reactive protein should be obtained if infection or malignancy is suspected.
