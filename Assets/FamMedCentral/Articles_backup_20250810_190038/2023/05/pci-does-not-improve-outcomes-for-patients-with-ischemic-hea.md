## Evaluating the Child With a Limp

Nailah Adams Morancie, Margaret R. Helton

The initial approach to acute shoulder injuries starts with a comprehensive history to understand the mechanism of injury and a complete shoulder examination, followed by imaging when indicated. Treatment can include surgical intervention or nonsurgical management.

## Dizziness: Evaluation and Management

Tyler S. Rogers, Mary Alice Noel, Benjamin Garcia

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms.

## Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia: Evaluation and Treatment

Emma J. Par, Chase A. Hughes, Pierce DeRico

More than two-thirds of infants develop jaundice, the clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia. Most cases are physiologic and benign. All newborns should be examined regularly, and bilirubin levels should be measured in those who appear jaundiced. Bilirubin levels...

## The Power in Our Words: Reducing Bias in Clinical Communication

Starting in 2021, the 21st Century Cures Act mandated that patients have free access to their medical records. In this era of OpenNotes, we continue to uncover ways our written communication affects patient experiences, physician-patient relationships, and clinical care.

## The AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use in Practice

Sara Keller, Melissa A. Miller, Sara E. Cosgrove

Improving antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care is an urgent need. Using the AHRQ Toolkit to Improve Antibiotic Use in Ambulatory Care can help practices meet their antibiotic stewardship goals.

## Oral Contraceptives During Breastfeeding, Hyperprolactinemia, Tonsillectomy, Anal Cancer, Postinflammatory Hyperpigmentation

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Baclofen for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder

The Cochrane review found moderate-certainty evidence to suggest that, compared with placebo, baclofen reduces the risk of relapse and increases the number of abstinent days in individuals with alcohol use disorder who have completed detoxification before treatment.

## Lung Cancer–Related Mortality and the Impact of Low-Dose Computed Tomography Screening

Kristina D. Werner, John W. Epling

Low-dose computed tomography screening decreases deaths from lung cancer in people 40 years and older with an absolute risk reduction of approximately 0.4% and a number needed to screen of approximately 226 people over an average of 8.8 years of follow-up to prevent one death.

## Insomnia Therapy: Listening to Music

William E. Cayley, Jr., John James

For adults with sleep problems or insomnia, listening to music at bedtime may improve sleep quality, sleep-onset latency, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency; listening to music may improve anxiety and overall quality of life.

## Serologic Screening for Genital Herpes Infection: Clinical Summary of the USPSTF Recommendation

Does telehealth allow for the effective delivery of preventive services for women, and how can it best be used to address these needs?

## Preventing Postpartum Hemorrhage

Leila Mende, Jestine MacDonald, Dara Jolly, Jon O. Neher, Sarah Safranek

Oxytocin plus misoprostol is more effective than oxytocin alone in reducing postpartum hem-orrhage after vaginal delivery. However, this combination causes more nausea and vomiting than oxytocin alone. Tranexamic acid plus oxytocin does not significantly reduce the rate of...
