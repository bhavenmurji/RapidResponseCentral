abstract: Growth faltering, previously known as failure to thrive, is a broad term
  describing children who do not reach their expected weight, length, or body mass
  index for age. Growth is assessed with standardized World Health Organization charts
  for children younger than two years and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  charts for children two years and older. Traditional criteria for growth faltering
  can be imprecise and difficult to track over time; therefore, use of anthropometric
  z scores are now recommended. These scores can be calculated with a single set of
  measurements to assess malnutrition severity. Inadequate caloric intake, the most
  common cause of growth faltering, is identified with a detailed feeding history
  and physical examination. Diagnostic testing is reserved for those who have severe
  malnutrition or symptoms concerning for high-risk conditions, or if initial treatment
  fails. In older children or those with comorbidities, it is important to screen
  for underlying eating disorders (e.g., avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder,
  anorexia nervosa, bulimia). Growth faltering can usually be managed by the primary
  care physician. If comorbid disease is identified, a multidisciplinary team (e.g.,
  nutritionist, psychologist, pediatric subspecialists) may be beneficial. Failure
  to recognize and treat growth faltering in the first two years of life may result
  in decreased adult height and cognitive potential.
