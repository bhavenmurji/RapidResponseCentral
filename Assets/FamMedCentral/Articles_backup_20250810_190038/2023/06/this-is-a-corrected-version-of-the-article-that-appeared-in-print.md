Common Foot Fractures Sabrina Silver, DO, CAQSM, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana Elizabeth Williams, MD, Eglin Family Medicine Residency, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland Meghan L.
Plunkett, MD, Eglin Family Medicine Residency, 96th Medical Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida Foot fractures account for about one-third of lower extremity fractures in adults.
They are typically caused by a crush injury or an axial or twisting force on the foot.
Patients usually present with bony point tenderness and swelling of the affected area.
Weight-bearing varies based on the extent of the fracture and the patient’s pain tolerance.
When a foot or toe fracture is suspected, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained.
The Ottawa foot and ankle rules can help determine the need for radiography after an acute ankle inversion injury.
Many foot fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot or a hard-soled shoe.
Weight-bearing and duration of immobilization are based on the stability of the fracture and the patient’s pain level.
Most toe fractures can be managed nonsurgically with a hard-soled shoe for two to six weeks.
Close attention should be paid to the great toe because of its role in weight-bearing, and physicians should follow specific guidelines for orthopedic referral.
Meta- tarsal shaft fractures are managed with a boot or hard-soled shoe for three to six weeks.
The proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal has varied rates of healing due to poor blood supply, and management is based on the fracture zone.
Lis- franc fractures are often overlooked; radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained, and physicians should look for widening of the tarsometatarsal joint.
Other tarsal bone fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot for four to six weeks when nonsurgical treatment is indicated.
Common foot fracture complications include arthritis, infection, malunion or nonunion, and compartment syn- drome. (Am Fam Physician. 2024; 109(2):119-129.

These fractures are catego- rized by zones (Figure 5).15 Zone 1 fractures are referred to as tuberosity avulsion fractures4,5 (Figure 6).
Management includes a hard-soled shoe or short leg walking cast or boot, with weight-bearing as tolerated; casting should be limited to two weeks to ensure an early return to range of motion.
Total treatment duration is symptom driven, and patients usually heal within four to eight weeks.
If pain lasts longer than six weeks, radiography should be repeated to ensure adequate healing.8,9 Zone 2 (Jones) fractures occur at the metaphyseal- diaphyseal junction (Figure 7).
This junction is located at the fourth and fifth metatarsal joint.
The mechanism of injury is traumatic forced adduction applied laterally while the foot is in plantar flexion.
These fractures are complicated by the risk of nonunion and slow healing due to poor blood sup- ply; therefore, surgical management should be considered.
Conservative management includes a short leg non–weight- bearing cast for six weeks followed by protected weight- bearing with a short leg non–weight-bearing cast or con- trolled ankle motion (CAM) boot for another one to six weeks based on radiographic and clinical healing.4,5 Zone 3 fractures occur at the proximal 1.5 cm of the diaphysis, most commonly as a result of microtrauma to the region.
Surgical management is similar to a zone 2 Anteroposterior view of a zone 1 fracture of the prox- fracture.9,25 However, due to the nature of a zone 3 injury, imal fifth metatarsal caused by a twisting injury.
This fracture was managed with a postoperative hard- soled shoe and limited weight-bearing for six weeks because of pain.
FIGURE 5 nonsurgical management is longer, with strict use of a short leg non–weight-bearing cast for up to 20 weeks.4,5 Patients with an avulsion fracture that has greater than 2 to 3 mm of displacement should be referred.
Referral should be strongly considered in active patients with fractures in zone 2 or 3 to decrease the risk of nonunion.8,9 In a system- atic review that included 237 patients with zone 2 fractures, Diaphyseal fracture (zone 3) the nonunion rate was 11% to 50% in the 121 patients who Jones fracture (zone 2) were managed nonsurgically, compared with 0% to 11% in Tuberosity avulsion fracture (zone 1) the 116 patients who were managed surgically.25 Patients with zone 2 fractures that are managed nonsurgically should Fracture zones of the proximal fifth metatarsal. be referred if there is nonunion after three months.
