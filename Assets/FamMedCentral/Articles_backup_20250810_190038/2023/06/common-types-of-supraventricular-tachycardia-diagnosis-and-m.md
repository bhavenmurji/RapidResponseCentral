abstract: 'Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an abnormal rapid cardiac rhythm
  that involves atrial or atrioventricular node tissue from the His bundle or above.
  Paroxysmal SVT, a subset of supraventricular dysrhythmias, has three common types:
  atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia,
  and atrial tachycardia. Presenting symptoms may include altered consciousness, chest
  pressure or discomfort, dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, or palpitations. Diagnostic
  evaluation may be performed in the outpatient setting and includes a comprehensive
  history and physical examination, electrocardiography, and laboratory workup. Extended
  cardiac monitoring with a Holter monitor or event recorder may be needed to confirm
  the diagnosis. Acute management of paroxysmal SVT is similar across the various
  types and is best completed in the emergency department or hospital setting. In
  patients who are hemodynamically unstable, synchronized cardioversion is first-line
  management. In those who are hemodynamically stable, vagal maneuvers are first-line
  management, followed by stepwise medication management if ineffective. Beta blockers
  and/or calcium channel blockers may be used acutely or for long-term suppressive
  therapy. When evaluating patients for paroxysmal SVTs, clinicians should have a
  low threshold for referral to a cardiologist for electrophysiologic study and appropriate
  intervention such as ablation. Clinicians should use a patient-centered approach
  when formulating a long-term management plan for atrioventricular nodal reentrant
  tachycardia. Catheter ablation has a high success rate and is recommended as the
  first-line method for long-term management of recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal
  SVT, including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.'
