The International Prostate Symptom Score is the best way to track symptoms. Self-management methods, including limiting evening fluid intake, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, toilet and bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and mindfulness techniques, can improve symptoms. Although saw palmetto is not effective, the herbal treatments Pygeum africanum and beta-sitosterol may be effective. Primary medical treatment involves alpha blockers or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Alpha blockers offer rapid benefit and can be used for acute urinary retention. Combining alpha blockers and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is not beneficial. For uncontrolled symptoms, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors should be started if the prostate volume is 30 mL or greater by ultrasonography. 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors take up to one year to be fully beneficial and are more effective when taken with alpha blockers. Only 1% of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms require surgery. Although transurethral resection of the prostate improves symptoms, many less invasive options with varying effectiveness can be considered.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in men. This article provides a review of the available patient-oriented evidence to evaluate and manage lower urinary tract symptoms from BPH. Use of the term “men” in this article is intended to include those who have male sex assigned at birth.

Lower urinary tract symptoms from BPH affect 38.1 million men older than 30 years in the United States, about one-fourth of all U.S. men.1 More than one-half have at least moderate symptoms, and one-third receive medical treatment.1

Potential causes of lower urinary tract symptoms are identified with patient factors.5 Relevant history includes fluid intake; history of sleep apnea; having diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or neurologic disorders; family cancer history; and tobacco use, alcohol consumption, sexual history, and current medications.

Important family history can include urethral, bladder, prostatic, or urothelial cancer. Having multiple sex partners increases risk of prostatitis.

The differential diagnosis for lower urinary tract symptoms is summarized in Table 2.6,7 Overactive bladder syndrome and detrusor overactivity are common and can exacerbate BPH.

Voiding symptoms include urinary hesitancy, delay in initiating, intermittency, weak urinary stream, and dysuria.2,8

The American Urological Association recommends the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS),5 shown in Table 3, which was originally called the American Urological Association symptom index9,10; it is the only symptom score to significantly predict urinary retention. An IPSS of 20 or higher, demonstrating severe lower urinary tract symptoms, has a positive likelihood ratio of 1.5 for bladder outlet obstruction; an IPSS of less than 20 has a negative likelihood ratio of 0.8.10

Physical examination focuses on suprapubic and genital regions to exclude other causes of lower urinary tract symptoms.7

Digital rectal examination can evaluate for prostate size, consistency, and tenderness; however, the examination reliably identifies only prostates larger than 50 mL.7

Urinalysis should be ordered to look for glucosuria, proteinuria, hematuria, and evidence of infection, with urine culture if necessary.2

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is not required for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Serum PSA is a limited predictor of prostate volume, risk of acute urinary retention, and need for surgery.11,12 Discussion of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening for shared decision-making is recommended before PSA testing for men 55 to 69 years of age; testing is discouraged in men 70 years or older.13

Urologists sometimes perform postvoid residual testing, uroflowmetry, and transrectal ultrasonography. However, postvoid residual testing is not useful for routine testing, with a positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 52% for bladder outlet obstruction.5 Uroflowmetry is not useful for initial evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms.5

Transrectal ultrasonography is more accurate than digital rectal examination at measuring prostate size. The American Urological Association recommends transrectal ultrasonography before treatment with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or surgery.5 However, the evidence that prostate-size measurement before medication initiation improves outcomes is limited.

The goal of treatment for BPH is to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms, prevent disease progression, and prevent complications such as urinary retention.

Low- to moderate-quality evidence suggests improvement in symptoms with self-management techniques, such as limited evening fluid intake, reduction of caffeine and alcohol intake, and toilet and bladder training. Toilet training involves techniques, such as double voiding, a repeated urination effort and urethral milking, and massaging the urethra from behind the scrotum toward the base of the penis. Bladder training involves incremental delayed voiding to regain bladder control as well as pelvic floor exercises or mindfulness.5,14–16

Table 4 provides first- and second-line medication treatment options for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.5,8,11,12,18–24

Alpha-blockers and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are first-line therapies. Combining these medications increases adverse effects, such as headache and muscle pain, with only slightly added benefit.8,19

Use of alpha-blockers leads to rapid improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms compared with placebo, based on 19 randomized controlled trials with nearly 10,000 participants.11 Symptom improvement is consistent among different alpha blockers.18

The nonselective alpha blockers terazosin and doxazosin (Cardura) lower blood pressure more than the selective alpha-1 blockers tamsulosin (Flomax) and alfuzosin (Uroxatral).25
