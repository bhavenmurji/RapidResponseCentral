Chamberlin, Pharm D The University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, Tennessee Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality.
Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home.
In patients 12 years and older, home man- agement includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/ long-acting beta agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/ 2 2 long-acting beta agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol.
In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/ 2 formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids.
In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta agonist and oxygen to maintain 2 oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticoste- 2 roids.
Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta agonist, and corticosteroids.
The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and 2 magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations.
Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department.
Improvement in symp- toms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge.
The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance ther- apy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations. (Am Fam Physician. 2024; 109(1):43-50.

Recommendations for the evaluation and lung function can vary among patients.8 management of acute asthma exacerbations are based on the Early Recognition and Risk Reduction Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines.
The most successful strategy for prevention of acute asthma exacerbations includes early recognition, management, and treatment.
It is important to identify patients at high risk.
