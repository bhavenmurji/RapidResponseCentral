abstract: Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external
  ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection.
  The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
  Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the
  canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of
  the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are
  the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides,
  polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence
  that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment
  is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient
  adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs
  outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes
  mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are
  found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention
  include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

## Abstract

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.
