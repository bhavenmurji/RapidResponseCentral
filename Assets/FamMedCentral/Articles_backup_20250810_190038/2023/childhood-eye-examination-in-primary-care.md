### Main Content


Approximately 7% of children in the United States younger than 18 years have a diagnosed eye disorder, and 1 in 4 children between two and 17 years of age wears glasses. Routine eye examinations during childhood can identify abnormalities necessitating referral to ophthalmology, which optimizes children's vision through the early diagnosis and treatment of abnormalities. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends vision screening at least once in children three to five years of age to detect amblyopia or its risk factors to improve visual acuity. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports this recommendation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening starting at three years of age and at regular intervals in childhood, and that instrument-based screening (e.g., photoscreening, autorefraction) is an alternative to vision charts for testing visual acuity in patients three to five years of age. Eye examinations include visual acuity testing, external examinations, assessing ocular alignment and pupillary response, and assessing for opacities with the red reflex examination. Common abnormalities include refractive errors, amblyopia (reduction in visual acuity in one eye not attributable to structural abnormality), and strabismus (misalignment of the eye). Rare diagnoses include retinoblastoma (often detectable through loss of red reflex), cataracts (detectable by an abnormal red reflex), and glaucoma (often manifests as light sensitivity with corneal cloudiness and enlargement).

Approximately 7% of children in the United States younger than 18 years have a diagnosed eye disorder, and 1 in 4 children between two and 17 years of age wear glasses.1,2 Routine eye examinations and vision screening during well-child examinations can identify risk factors and abnormalities consistent with those eye disorders and lead to a referral to ophthalmology. Subsequent diagnosis and treatment can optimize a child's eye health and vision, thereby minimizing or avoiding developmental delays, impaired school performance, and problems with social interactions and self-esteem.3

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends vision screening at least once in all children three to five years of age (grade B recommendation) to detect amblyopia or its risk factors to improve visual acuity.4 The benefits of vision screening to detect amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than three years are uncertain according to the USPSTF, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined (grade C recommendation).4 The American Academy of Family Physicians supports this recommendation.5 The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that components of the visual screening occur at every well-child examination6 (Table 16–8). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends beginning vision screening at four to five years of age and as early as three years of age in cooperative children.9 Instrument-based screening (e.g., photoscreening) is recommended starting at 12 months of age.10,11

Comprehensive personal and family histories, including parental observations, are important components of visual and eye screening examinations (Table 2).11,12 A personal history that warrants a referral to ophthalmology includes premature birth, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy.

The eye examination should include an external examination, pupillary response, corneal light reflex, red reflex, fixation and alignment, cover and cover-uncover, and visual acuity testing. American Family Physician provides videos demonstrating eye examinations in infants/toddlers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hjONYSfjS8) and preschoolers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRqk5vqWMy0).

Pupillary response should be assessed in light and darkness using a light source to illuminate the pupil while the child's attention is directed toward a remote target of interest (e.g., a toy). Pupils should be compared for size and symmetry. A difference in pupil size greater than 1 mm can be a sign of underlying pathology.

To test the corneal reflex, the clinician should center light on the pupils to assess if there is an equal light reflex. This can be accomplished most naturally during the external inspection and assessment of pupillary response. A toy in front of the child can help keep the child's gaze still, making the assessment easier.

Light reflex should be symmetric by four to six months of age. Light reflex helps differentiate pseudostrabismus from strabismus (i.e., a misalignment of the eyes). A light reflex in patients with pseudostrabismus is normal despite a wide nasal bridge or epicanthal fold that may initially make the eyes appear to be misaligned (Figure 1 and Figure 212).

Red reflex testing is recommended starting in the neonatal period and continuing through subsequent well-child examinations. This test is critical for detecting vision and serious abnormalities such as cataracts, glaucoma, retinoblastoma, retinal disorders, systemic diseases with ocular manifestations, and high refractive errors.6

The child is held or seated in a darkened room in a comfortable position that allows the clinician to view both pupils. The ophthalmoscope lens is held 18 inches (46 cm) away from the child. The light source should illuminate both eyes and be equal in reflectance. Abnormal reflexes can include diminished reflex, dark spots, a white reflex, or asymmetry between the eyes6 (Figure 312).

Typically, children as young as six weeks have some response to the examiner's face. By two months of age, the infant should consistently fix and follow; however, before two months of age, it is normal for one or both eyes to deviate temporarily. A failure to fix and follow in a room with visual distractors may be a sign of delayed visual maturation. By two months of age, this should resolve.

Cover and cover-uncover tests assess for strabismus. Tropia is a deviation of the eye, also known as manifest strabismus, whereas phoria is latent strabismus. An exophoria is a type of strabismus that is evident only temporarily when the child is stressed or tired. An exotropia is a type of strabismus that occurs more frequently and is often more noticeable than other types of strabismus. The examiner will observe that one eye appears deviated (affected or strabismic) and the other is fixed on an object (unaffected or fixating). When the fixating eye is covered, the strabismic eye will move into alignment. When the fixating eye is uncovered, the strabismic eye will return to its deviated position. If the strabismic eye is covered, the fixating eye will not move (Figure 4).12

In the cover-uncover test, the child's attention is attracted to a distant or near target and eye alignment is observed. The eye to be tested is covered for a few seconds. On uncovering the eye, it will be out of alignment and move back to alignment. This is a positive test for exophoria. Minimal phoria can be a normal variant. The eye alignment may look normal on binocular viewing, but movement is noted after one eye is occluded. A positive test to a near target is consistent with an accommodative esotropia if the eye turns in because the child has uncorrected farsightedness. If the eye turns out while viewing a distant target, the child has intermittent exotropia, which is the most common form of strabismus and can be caused by problems with innervation or uncorrected nearsightedness.

The alternating cover test can also measure binocular eye involvement. Rapid alternate covering of each eye may elicit a latent eye movement, including esophoria and exophoria.13

Literate children can use the Snellen visual acuity chart (Figure 514); however, Sloan letter charts have been more recently recommended if available.11 Preliterate children can use picture charts such as the LEA (Figure 615) or matching charts such as the HOTV (Figure 714).

Each eye should be tested independently, with the opposite eye occluded to discourage peeking. The Multi-Ethnic Pediatric Eye Disease Study provided updated norms for visual acuity in children between two and five years of age16 (Table 311,12,16). At any age, visual acuity should be equal between both eyes (no more than two lines different). Most children do not have 20/20 vision until after six years of age.16

When testing, the large letters or figures at the top of the chart should be reviewed with both child's eyes open to help them understand the test. Then, one eye is occluded to perform the test.

The threshold line or critical line evaluation may be used. Threshold line testing asks the child to start at the top of the eye chart and read down each line until they reach the smallest line they can discern with each eye separately. Although this allows the health care professional to identify the best acuity level in each eye and detect children with near-normal acuity who have a mild difference between each eye, it is time-consuming and easy to lose the child's attention. The critical line method can be more quickly administered and can be an alternative to detect children with potentially serious vision concerns. The child is asked to read the “critical line” for their age, and if they can, it is unnecessary to measure below the age-specific critical line11 (Table 311,12,16).

The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends referral for children five years and older who cannot read three or more letters or figures on the 20/30 line or has a two-line difference between eyes because this may indicate amblyopia (i.e., one eye has worse visual acuity than the other).6

Instrument-based screening using photoscreening or autorefraction can detect ocular risk factors that may result in vision loss in children. Photoscreening devices use optical images of the red reflex to detect refractive errors and strabismus.17 Autorefractors use automated retinoscopy to evaluate refractive error and are particularly useful in preverbal children, young children, or older children who are noncooperative or nonverbal.11,18
