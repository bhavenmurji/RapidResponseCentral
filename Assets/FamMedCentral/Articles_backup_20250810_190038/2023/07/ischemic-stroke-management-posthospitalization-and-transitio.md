### Main Content


Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack exist on a continuum of the same disease process. Ischemic stroke is common, and more than 85% of stroke risk is attributed to modifiable risk factors. The initial management of acute stroke is usually performed in the emergency department and hospital settings. Family physicians have a key role in follow-up, ensuring that a complete diagnostic evaluation has been performed, addressing modifiable risk factors, facilitating rehabilitation, and managing chronic sequelae. Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke includes optimization of chronic disease management (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia), nonpharmacologic lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet changes, exercise, substance use counseling), and pharmacologic interventions. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is generally indicated for minor noncardioembolic ischemic strokes and high-risk transient ischemic attacks and should be converted to single antiplatelet therapy after 21 to 90 days. Secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke requires long-term anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred over warfarin for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Poststroke problems with mobility, balance, cognition, dysphagia, and depression are common. Rehabilitation involves a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach that includes physical therapy, speech therapy, and treatment of chronic pain and poststroke depression.

Ischemic stroke is the result of a sudden blockage of blood flow to the central nervous system due to thrombotic or embolic phenomena, and it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2019, stroke was the fifth leading cause of death in the United States.1 Although stroke can be hemorrhagic or ischemic, approximately 87% of strokes in the United States are ischemic.2 Almost 800,000 strokes occur annually in the United States, often leading to long-term disability.2

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient neurologic dysfunction caused by ischemia without infarction on imaging. Because the subsequent risk of stroke after TIA is similar to that of an initial stroke, TIA is treated similarly to a minor, nondisabling stroke. In this article, TIA is included with ischemic stroke, except where noted.

It is estimated that 87% of stroke risk is attributable to modifiable risk factors.2 Risk factors for ischemic stroke are listed in Table 1.3,4

Similar to many conditions, stroke is associated with health disparities. Compared with White people, Black people in the United States have strokes at younger ages and have more poststroke disability, much of which is related to modifiable risk factors.5 Increasing age and female sex are associated with greater poststroke disability.5 Stroke risk also varies with education level, income, zip code, health insurance, and social isolation, and assessing these factors is important for the primary and secondary prevention of stroke.6

Although the initial management of acute stroke usually occurs in the emergency and hospital settings, the outpatient follow-up evaluation is critical to ensure that the appropriate testing has been completed, reviewed, and discussed with the patient.7 Certain parts of the evaluation to determine the cause of the stroke may be deferred until outpatient follow-up. Table 2 summarizes the evaluation of stroke on the basis of pathogenesis.3,7,8

At the first primary care visit after stroke, diagnostic imaging should be reviewed to confirm the diagnosis.3 Although computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both used to diagnose stroke, MRI has 99% sensitivity for stroke, compared with 39% with CT, and can diagnose acute ischemic strokes missed by CT.8 If initial imaging was negative for stroke despite characteristic symptoms, follow-up CT or MRI may be indicated to confirm the diagnosis.3,7

Atrial fibrillation is estimated to cause approximately 1 in 7 strokes.9 In addition to electrocardiography performed during the initial evaluation of stroke, continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring is often performed during hospitalization.3 Long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring (e.g., 30-day event monitor, implantable loop recorder) increases the detection of atrial fibrillation and is useful in the evaluation of cryptogenic stroke.3,10

The initial evaluation of stroke includes laboratory testing to identify underlying risk factors and determine therapeutic targets.3 Complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, glucose, A1C, creatinine, and lipid profile are recommended to identify risk factors such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and blood cell dyscrasia. If stroke is determined to be cryptogenic based on the initial evaluation, expanded laboratory assessment, including testing for hypercoagulable states (e.g., prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden, protein C and S deficiencies, antithrombin deficiency), infection, drug use, and connective tissue, inflammatory, and genetic disorders, may be indicated.

Polysomnography can also be considered to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea. This condition is both a risk factor for stroke and a common comorbidity in patients with previous stroke (approximately 40% of stroke cases); however, it is unclear whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure prevents recurrent vascular events.3

Recurrent stroke risk is high, accounting for approximately 25% of all annual strokes in the United States, with the greatest risk of recurrence within the first week after a stroke.11 Numerous nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies can help mitigate this risk.

Diets high in fat, processed meat, fried food, and sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke in adults.12 The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend a Mediterranean-style diet or a low-sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for patients who have had a stroke.3,13 Increased physical activity is also recommended to prevent stroke recurrence.3

Although the recommendation for 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise applies to stroke survivors over the long-term, engaging in at least 10 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise four times per week, or 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise two times per week, has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Breaking up sedentary time with three minutes of light activity every 30 minutes improves blood pressure.3,14

Weight loss is encouraged to improve comorbid hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Substance use, including smoking, heavy alcohol use (more than four drinks per day for men or more than three drinks per day for women), and illicit stimulant use (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), should be addressed and treated. Table 3 details lifestyle recommendations after stroke.3,13–15

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for stroke. The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend an ambulatory blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg, if tolerated, for adults with a history of stroke.3 When choosing an anti-hypertensive medication, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.3 Although calcium channel blockers are first-line treatment options for hypertension, their effectiveness for the secondary prevention of stroke is unproven.3

The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend an A1C goal of less than 7%.3 Intensive glycemic control has not been shown to improve the risk of recurrent stroke.3 Patients who are 65 years and older or have limited life expectancy may require less stringent A1C goals, consistent with American Diabetes Association recommendations.15 When possible, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors should be considered to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.3,15

The AHA/ASA guidelines recommend atorvastatin, 80 mg per day, or rosuvastatin (Crestor), 20 mg per day, to decrease the risk of recurrent stroke for patients with an atherosclerotic ischemic stroke and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level greater than 100 mg per dL (2.59 mmol per L).3 For patients taking a statin, the LDL cholesterol goal is less than 70 mg per dL (1.81 mmol per L), regardless of history of coronary artery disease. If the LDL cholesterol goal cannot be achieved with statin monotherapy, the addition of ezetimibe or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor may be considered.3

Indefinite antiplatelet therapy is indicated for secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke and cryptogenic stroke that do not appear to be embolic. Choice of antiplatelet drug depends on patient-specific factors such as tolerance, contraindications, presence of other vascular disease, availability, and cost.3 Aspirin, clopidogrel, and the combination of aspirin, 25 mg, and extended-release dipyridamole, 200 mg, are indicated for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.

Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy can reduce the recurrence of some mild strokes.16,17 After minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 3 or less (https://www.stroke.nih.gov/documents/NIH_Stroke_Scale_508C.pdf) or high-risk TIA with an ABCD2 score of 4 or greater (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/357/abcd2-score-tia), the AHA/ASA guidelines recommend short-term treatment with aspirin, 81 mg per day, and clopidogrel, 75 mg per day, following initial loading doses of aspirin, 325 mg, and clopidogrel, 300 mg. Anti-platelet monotherapy or combination aspirin/dipyridamole therapy should be resumed indefinitely after 21 to 90 days.3 A shorter 10- to 21-day course of dual antiplatelet therapy before monotherapy may provide a similar benefit while minimizing bleeding risk.18 Use of dual antiplatelet therapy beyond 90 days confers no further risk reduction for prevention of recurrent stroke compared with single antiplatelet therapy but significantly increases bleeding risk.18

Long-term antiplatelet therapy regimens can include aspirin, 50 to 325 mg once per day; clopidogrel, 75 mg once per day; or combination aspirin, 25 mg, and extended-release dipyridamole, 200 mg, twice per day.19–21 Triple antiplatelet therapy should be avoided.3 It is unclear whether patients already taking aspirin at the time of noncardioembolic stroke or TIA benefit from increasing the dosage or changing to a different antiplatelet therapy.3
