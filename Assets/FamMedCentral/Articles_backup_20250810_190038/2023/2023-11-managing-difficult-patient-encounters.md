abstract: Family physicians commonly find themselves in difficult patient encounters
  that can result in dissatisfaction for the patient and physician. Successful navigation
  of these encounters includes recognizing common physician factors, such as systemic
  pressures, interpersonal communication, and situational issues. The practice of
  labeling patient types can lead to disparities in care and patient harm and should
  be avoided. When physicians recognize that they are in a difficult patient encounter,
  simple mindfulness approaches, such as the Name It to Tame It and CALMER approaches,
  can improve outcomes. CALMER approaches help physicians acknowledge which situations
  they can control, alter their thoughts about the situation, and tolerate uncertainty.
  Physicians working with patients to create a therapeutic bond can focus the encounter
  to understand the situation that the patient is experiencing and work to recognize
  and acknowledge strong emotions that are nonproductive. Negotiating an agenda can
  help manage expectations of what can reasonably be done during each visit. Supporting
  patients by validating their symptoms and helping them embrace uncertainty can enable
  them to take control of their diagnosis and focus on managing chronic conditions
  rather than curing them. Motivational interviewing is a useful tool to help patients
  take ownership of their illnesses and therapeutic goals. Self-care through reflection
  groups or personal coaching or counseling can help physicians feel supported and
  avoid burnout.

## Abstract

Family physicians commonly find themselves in difficult patient encounters that can result in dissatisfaction for the patient and physician. Successful navigation of these encounters includes recognizing common physician factors, such as systemic pressures, interpersonal communication, and situational issues. The practice of labeling patient types can lead to disparities in care and patient harm and should be avoided. When physicians recognize that they are in a difficult patient encounter, simple mindfulness approaches, such as the Name It to Tame It and CALMER approaches, can improve outcomes. CALMER approaches help physicians acknowledge which situations they can control, alter their thoughts about the situation, and tolerate uncertainty. Physicians working with patients to create a therapeutic bond can focus the encounter to understand the situation that the patient is experiencing and work to recognize and acknowledge strong emotions that are nonproductive. Negotiating an agenda can help manage expectations of what can reasonably be done during each visit. Supporting patients by validating their symptoms and helping them embrace uncertainty can enable them to take control of their diagnosis and focus on managing chronic conditions rather than curing them. Motivational interviewing is a useful tool to help patients take ownership of their illnesses and therapeutic goals. Self-care through reflection groups or personal coaching or counseling can help physicians feel supported and avoid burnout.
