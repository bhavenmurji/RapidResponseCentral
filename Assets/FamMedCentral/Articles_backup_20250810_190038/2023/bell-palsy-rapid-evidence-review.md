abstract: Bell palsy should be suspected in patients with acute onset of unilateral
  facial weakness or paralysis involving the forehead in the absence of other neurologic
  abnormalities. The overall prognosis is good. More than two-thirds of patients with
  typical Bell palsy have a complete spontaneous recovery. For children and pregnant
  women, the rate of complete recovery is up to 90%. Bell palsy is idiopathic. Laboratory
  testing and imaging are not required for diagnosis. When other causes of facial
  weakness are being considered, laboratory testing may identify a treatable cause.
  An oral corticosteroid regimen (prednisone, 50 to 60 mg per day for five days followed
  by a five-day taper) is the first-line treatment for Bell palsy. Combination therapy
  with an oral corticosteroid and antiviral may reduce rates of synkinesis (misdirected
  regrowth of facial nerve fibers manifesting as involuntary co-contraction of certain
  facial muscles). Recommended antivirals include valacyclovir (1 g three times per
  day for seven days) or acyclovir (400 mg five times per day for 10 days). Treatment
  with antivirals alone is ineffective and not recommended. Physical therapy may be
  beneficial in patients with more severe paralysis.
