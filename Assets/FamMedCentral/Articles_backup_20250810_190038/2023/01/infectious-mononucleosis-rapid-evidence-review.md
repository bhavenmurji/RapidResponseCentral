abstract: Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis,
  and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus
  and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary
  transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly
  their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious
  mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater
  than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile
  antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity
  of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years
  and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes
  increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative
  heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing
  is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than
  the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive;
  routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines
  recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic
  activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be
  used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations
  are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus
  infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

### Main Content


Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever, is a viral syndrome characterized by a triad of fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy.1–3 This article presents a brief evidence-based review of the diagnosis and treatment of infectious mononucleosis.

Most cases of infectious mononucleosis are caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), although approximately 10% of cases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV).2–4 Other viruses, such as human herpesvirus 6, adenovirus, and herpes simplex, can cause an illness similar to mononucleosis.

Infection with EBV is most common in childhood and adolescence, and males and females are affected equally.5 Studies show that two-thirds of children and adolescents six to 19 years of age in the United States and more than 95% of adults 20 to 25 years of age in the United Kingdom are seropositive.6–8

In wealthier nations, infectious mononucleosis mostly affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age (6 to 8 cases per 1,000 person-years), particularly those living in communal environments, such as dormitories or military barracks (11 to 48 cases per 1,000 person-years).2

The primary mode of disease transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva, including sharing eating utensils or water bottles, kissing, or through sexual intercourse.1,9,10

The incubation period for EBV infection is 32 to 49 days, during which the patient is contagious.1 Viral replication is first detected in the oral cavity and has also been isolated in genital secretions.1,9

Hoagland criteria, which are often used to aid in the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, include greater than 50% lymphocytes and 10% atypical lymphocytes in the presence of fever, pharyngitis, and adenopathy, with confirmatory serologic testing.3,12

Table 2 shows the accuracy of symptoms and signs in the diagnosis of clinically suspected infectious mononucleosis.15

Common symptoms include pharyngitis, malaise, loss of appetite, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhea, nasal congestion). Abdominal pain may occur.10

Tonsillar exudate is seen in 50% of people with infectious mononucleosis. Palatal petechiae are more suggestive of infectious mononucleosis but are less common than tonsillar exudate and may also be seen in streptococcal pharyngitis.15 Tonsillar inflammation is nonspecific.

Infectious mononucleosis classically presents as posterior cervical lymphadenopathy; however, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy are also common and help distinguish infectious mononucleosis from other types of infectious pharyngitis.14,15 A recent meta-analysis found that the sign or symptom that most strongly predicts infectious mononucleosis is posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (positive likelihood ratio [LR+] = 3.2).15

Less than 5% of those with infectious mononucleosis present with a maculopapular, urticarial, or petechial rash.16 The rash usually occurs with recent amoxicillin use.

Splenic enlargement is nearly universal in infectious mononucleosis.17 Physical examination is unreliable for identifying splenomegaly and has a wide range of sensitivity (20% to 70%) and specificity (69% to 100%).14

Children younger than five years often present with fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy but are more likely than adolescents and adults to present with rash, palpable splenomegaly, and upper respiratory tract symptoms.18

Patients with HIV infection can develop secondary conditions caused by EBV, including lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphoproliferation, and malignant transformations of lymphoid, muscle, and epithelial cells.19

The accuracy of diagnostic laboratory testing for infectious mononucleosis is presented in Table 3.11,15

Initial testing for acute infectious mononucleosis should include complete blood count with differential and a rapid heterophile antibody test.2,14,20,21 Testing for streptococcal pharyngitis should be considered if indicated.

Parameters for atypical lymphocytes that strongly suggest infectious mononucleosis are greater than 10% (LR+ = 9.0), greater than 20% (LR+ = 28), and greater than 40% (LR+ = 50).15

The heterophile antibody latex agglutination test (monospot) is an inexpensive, rapid test with 87% sensitivity and 91% specificity reported in a systematic review.20 However, the study design likely resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than would be seen in routine office practice, especially early in the disease course.
