abstract: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less
  than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health
  Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal
  cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses,
  gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia
  that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or
  less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying
  cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred
  if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level
  greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion,
  transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies
  cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels.
  Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms
  (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present.
  Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics,
  and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal
  disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium
  zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or
  acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal
  adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting
  underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.
