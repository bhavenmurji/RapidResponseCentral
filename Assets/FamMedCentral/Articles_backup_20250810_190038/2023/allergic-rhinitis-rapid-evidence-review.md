abstract: Allergic rhinitis, the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States,
  is an immunoglobulin E-mediated process. A family history of allergic rhinitis,
  asthma, or atopic dermatitis increases a patient's risk of being diagnosed with
  allergic rhinitis. People in the United States are commonly sensitized to grass,
  dust mites, and ragweed allergens. Dust mite-proof mattress covers do not prevent
  allergic rhinitis in children two years and younger. Diagnosis is clinical and based
  on history, physical examination, and at least one symptom of nasal congestion,
  runny or itchy nose, or sneezing. History should include whether the symptoms are
  seasonal or perennial, symptom triggers, and severity. Common examination findings
  are clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, swollen nasal turbinates, watery eye discharge,
  conjunctival swelling, and allergic shiners (i.e., dark circles under the eyes).
  Serum or skin testing for specific allergens should be performed when there is inadequate
  response to empiric treatment, if diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide initiation
  or titration of therapy. Intranasal corticosteroids are first-line treatment for
  allergic rhinitis. Second-line therapies include antihistamines and leukotriene
  receptor antagonists and neither shows superiority. If allergy testing is performed,
  trigger-directed immunotherapy can be effectively delivered subcutaneously or sublingually.
  High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are not effective at decreasing allergy
  symptoms. Approximately 1 in 10 patients with allergic rhinitis will develop asthma.

### Main Content


Allergic rhinitis, the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States, is an immunoglobulin E–mediated process. A family history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis increases a patient's risk of being diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. People in the United States are commonly sensitized to grass, dust mites, and ragweed allergens. Dust mite–proof mattress covers do not prevent allergic rhinitis in children two years and younger. Diagnosis is clinical and based on history, physical examination, and at least one symptom of nasal congestion, runny or itchy nose, or sneezing. History should include whether the symptoms are seasonal or perennial, symptom triggers, and severity. Common examination findings are clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, swollen nasal turbinates, watery eye discharge, conjunctival swelling, and allergic shiners (i.e., dark circles under the eyes). Serum or skin testing for specific allergens should be performed when there is inadequate response to empiric treatment, if diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide initiation or titration of therapy. Intranasal corticosteroids are first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis. Second-line therapies include antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists and neither shows superiority. If allergy testing is performed, trigger-directed immunotherapy can be effectively delivered subcutaneously or sublingually. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are not effective at decreasing allergy symptoms. Approximately 1 in 10 patients with allergic rhinitis will develop asthma.

Allergic rhinitis is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States.1,2 It is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated process, and a clinical diagnosis is made based on common signs and symptoms, physical examination findings, and family and social history. This rapid evidence review highlights current literature and research on the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Approximately 15% to 30% of people in the United States have allergic rhinitis. Estimates of the direct economic burden range from $2 billion to $5 billion annually.2,3

Allergic rhinitis is caused by IgE-mediated reactions against inhaled allergens. IgE-mediated cross-linking activates mast cells and basophils, releasing histamine and leukotrienes that cause edema, vasodilation, nasal obstruction, and central nervous system reflexes that cause sneezing.1

In the United States, patients with allergic rhinitis are commonly sensitized to grass, dust mites, and ragweed allergens.4

Allergic rhinitis is the most common medical reason employees miss time from work and is associated with the largest productivity loss for employers.5

In children and adolescents, allergic rhinitis is associated with increased school absenteeism, irritability, inattention, and sleep disruption.2,3,6

Dust mite–proof mattress covers do not prevent allergic rhinitis symptoms in children two years and younger.7

Exclusively breastfeeding infants at three, six, and 12 months of age does not reduce the rate of allergic rhinitis symptoms at six years of age.8

The American Academy of Otolaryngology– Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's allergic rhinitis guideline was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians in 2014 and reaffirmed in April 2020.2,9

Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is based on patient history, physical examination, and at least one of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny or itchy nose, or sneezing.2 Table 1 shows the accuracy of medical history for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.10

Other symptoms include itchy or watery eyes, sniffling, and postnasal drip. History should include whether the symptoms are seasonal or perennial, symptom triggers, and severity. Family history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis makes the diagnosis more likely.2,10,11

Triggers unlikely to be related to allergic rhinitis (e.g., smoke, fumes, chemicals), unilateral nasal symptoms, and the use of medications known to cause nasal symptoms (e.g., antihypertensives such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; psychotropic agents; rebound effects from topical decongestants) suggest another possible diagnosis.12,13

Physical examination findings are often nonspecific but increase the likelihood of allergic rhinitis when combined with history.12

Common examination findings include clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, swelling of the nasal turbinates, watery eye discharge, conjunctival swelling, and allergic shiners (i.e., dark circles under the eyes).12

Interrater reliability of the clinical assessment of turbinate hypertrophy (kappa = 0.31, range = 0 to 1.0) and turbinate color (kappa = 0.38) is modest.14

It is reasonable to diagnose and begin empiric treatment for allergic rhinitis based on history and physical examination.2,9

Allergy testing should be performed when there is inadequate response to empiric treatment, when diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide initiation or titration of therapy.2

Blood serum tests determine the level of allergen-specific IgE in a serum sample.1 However, IgE levels do not necessarily correlate with clinical severity. In one study, the highest levels of IgE induced the weakest biologic reactions (i.e., mean wheal diameter of skin reaction).16

Skin testing is more sensitive (80% to 90%) compared with blood serum testing (average sensitivity = 70% to 75%), less expensive, and provides immediate results.17–20 Blood serum testing is more specific (80% to 100%).21
