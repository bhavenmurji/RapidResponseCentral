## Abstract

Primary care for women and other patients with similar reproductive potential can include a discussion about pregnancy and, depending on the patient's intent, contraceptive care or preconception care. Folic acid supplementation of at least 400 mcg per day is recommended to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, because many pregnancies are unplanned. Having a body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg per m2 before pregnancy also reduces complications. Patients with a history of bariatric surgery should delay pregnancy for at least 12 months post-procedure and ensure that their nutritional status is adequate before conception. It is essential to review the patient's medications and chronic medical conditions to avoid teratogens and optimize treatment before conception to reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Having a prepregnancy A1C level of less than 6.5% is strongly recommended for patients with diabetes mellitus to minimize congenital anomalies and complications. Vaccinations should be updated to prevent adverse outcomes related to infections. Infectious disease screenings should be updated before conception to allow for treatment, prophylaxis, or timing of pregnancy to avoid complications. Screening and counseling should be provided for substance use and potential environmental exposures to identify and mitigate detrimental exposures before pregnancy.
