abstract: Syncope is an abrupt, transient, and complete loss of consciousness associated
  with an inability to maintain postural tone; recovery is rapid and spontaneous.
  The condition is common, resulting in about 1.7 million emergency department visits
  in 2019. The immediate cause of syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion, which may occur
  due to systemic vasodilation, decreased cardiac output, or both. The primary classifications
  of syncope are cardiac, reflex (neurogenic), and orthostatic. Evaluation focuses
  on history, physical examination (including orthostatic blood pressure measurements),
  and electrocardiographic results. If the findings are inconclusive and indicate
  possible adverse outcomes, additional testing may be considered. However, testing
  has limited utility, except in patients with cardiac syncope. Prolonged electrocardiographic
  monitoring, stress testing, and echocardiography may be beneficial in patients at
  higher risk of adverse outcomes from cardiac syncope. Neuroimaging should be ordered
  only when findings suggest a neurologic event or a head injury is suspected. Laboratory
  tests may be ordered based on history and physical examination findings (e.g., hemoglobin
  measurement if gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected). Patients are designated
  as having lower or higher risk of adverse outcomes according to history, physical
  examination, and electrocardiographic results, which can inform decisions regarding
  hospital admission. Risk stratification tools, such as the Canadian Syncope Risk
  Score, may be beneficial in this decision; some tools include cardiac biomarkers
  as a component. The prognosis of patients with reflex and orthostatic syncope is
  good; cardiac syncope is more likely to be associated with adverse outcomes.
