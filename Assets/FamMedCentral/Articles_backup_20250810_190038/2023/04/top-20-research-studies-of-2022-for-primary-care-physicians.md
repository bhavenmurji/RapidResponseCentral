abstract: This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2022 identified as
  POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters), excluding COVID-19. Statins for
  primary prevention of cardiovascular disease produce only a small absolute reduction
  in a person's likelihood of dying (0.6%), having a myocardial infarction (0.7%),
  or having a stroke (0.3%) over three to six years. Supplemental vitamin D does not
  reduce the risk of a fragility fracture, even in people with low baseline vitamin
  D levels or a previous fracture. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are preferred
  medical therapy for panic disorder, and patients who discontinue antidepressants
  are more likely to relapse (number needed to harm = 6) compared with those who continue.
  Combination therapy using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin-norepinephrine
  reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant with mirtazapine or trazodone is
  more effective than monotherapy for first-line treatment of acute severe depression
  and when monotherapy fails. Using hypnotic agents for insomnia in adults comes with
  a significant trade-off between effectiveness and tolerability. In patients with
  moderate to severe asthma, using a combination of albuterol and glucocorticoid inhalers
  as rescue therapy reduces exacerbations and need for systemic steroids. Observational
  research shows an increased risk of gastric cancer in patients taking proton pump
  inhibitors (number needed to harm = 1,191 over 10 years). The American College of
  Gastroenterology updated its guideline for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and
  a new guideline provides sound advice for the evaluation and management of irritable
  bowel syndrome. Adults older than 60 years with prediabetes are more likely to become
  normoglycemic than to develop diabetes mellitus or die. Treatment of prediabetes
  via intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin has no impact on long-term cardiovascular
  outcomes. Persons with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy have similar degrees
  of improvement with monotherapy using amitriptyline, duloxetine, or pregabalin and
  greater improvement with combination therapy. When communicating with patients about
  disease risk, most patients prefer numbers over words because people overestimate
  word-based probabilities. In terms of drug therapy, the duration of an initial varenicline
  prescription should be 12 weeks. Many drugs can interact with cannabidiol. No important
  difference was found among ibuprofen, ketorolac, and diclofenac for treatment of
  acute nonradicular low back pain in adults.

## Abstract

This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2022 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters), excluding COVID-19. Statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease produce only a small absolute reduction in a person's likelihood of dying (0.6%), having a myocardial infarction (0.7%), or having a stroke (0.3%) over three to six years. Supplemental vitamin D does not reduce the risk of a fragility fracture, even in people with low baseline vitamin D levels or a previous fracture. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are preferred medical therapy for panic disorder, and patients who discontinue antidepressants are more likely to relapse (number needed to harm = 6) compared with those who continue. Combination therapy using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant with mirtazapine or trazodone is more effective than monotherapy for first-line treatment of acute severe depression and when monotherapy fails. Using hypnotic agents for insomnia in adults comes with a significant trade-off between effectiveness and tolerability. In patients with moderate to severe asthma, using a combination of albuterol and glucocorticoid inhalers as rescue therapy reduces exacerbations and need for systemic steroids. Observational research shows an increased risk of gastric cancer in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (number needed to harm = 1,191 over 10 years). The American College of Gastroenterology updated its guideline for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a new guideline provides sound advice for the evaluation and management of irritable bowel syndrome. Adults older than 60 years with prediabetes are more likely to become normoglycemic than to develop diabetes mellitus or die. Treatment of prediabetes via intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin has no impact on long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Persons with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy have similar degrees of improvement with monotherapy using amitriptyline, duloxetine, or pregabalin and greater improvement with combination therapy. When communicating with patients about disease risk, most patients prefer numbers over words because people overestimate word-based probabilities. In terms of drug therapy, the duration of an initial varenicline prescription should be 12 weeks. Many drugs can interact with cannabidiol. No important difference was found among ibuprofen, ketorolac, and diclofenac for treatment of acute nonradicular low back pain in adults.

The annual installment of this series summarizes the top studies of 2022, which were summarized as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters). Topics in this group of studies include preventive health care, behavioral health, asthma, gastroenterology, and diabetes.

## Bell Palsy: Rapid Evidence Review

Sarah N. Dalrymple, Jessica H. Row, John Gazewood

Bell palsy is the acute onset of unilateral facial weakness or paralysis. Treatment includes oral corticosteroids with or without oral antivirals. The overall prognosis is good, and most patients recover completely within three weeks.

## Electronic Cigarettes for Smoking Cessation

Because no data from a long-term safety profile are available, we have assigned a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) to this review, despite the promising certainty of evidence supporting nicotine e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Diagnosing Acute Appendicitis

In pregnant patients, children, and adults with clinical signs and symptoms of appendicitis, MRI has an overall sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 96%. The posttest probability of having appendicitis after a positive MRI is 90% and 2% after a negative MRI, assuming a...

## Accuracy of Point-of-Care Rapid Antigen Tests for Diagnosis of COVID-19

Karl T. Clebak, Jessica Snyder, Todd M. Felix

SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests have an average sensitivity of 69.3% and specificity of 99.3%. Accuracy depends on the presence or absence of symptoms, time from symptom onset, and test brand.

## Relationships Matter: Primary Care Physicians and Usual Sources of Care

Alison N. Huffstetler, Anuradha Jetty, Ann Greiner, Yalda Jabbarpour

There are benefits to having a primary care physician or a usual source of care. Yet, the overall percentage of U.S. patients who reported having a usual source of care declined from 84% in 2000 to 74% in 2019, with wide variations across states, patient race, and insurance...
