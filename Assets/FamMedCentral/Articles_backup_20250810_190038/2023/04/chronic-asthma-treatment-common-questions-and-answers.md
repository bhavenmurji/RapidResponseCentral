abstract: Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, and 62%
  of adults with asthma do not have adequately controlled symptoms. Asthma severity
  and level of control should be assessed at diagnosis and evaluated at subsequent
  visits using validated tools such as the Asthma Control Test or the asthma APGAR
  (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy) tools.
  Short-acting beta2 agonists are preferred asthma reliever medications. Controller
  medications consist of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, long-acting
  muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Treatment typically
  begins with inhaled corticosteroids, and additional medications or dosage increases
  should be added in a stepwise fashion according to guideline-directed therapy recommendations
  from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program or the Global Initiative
  for Asthma when symptoms are inadequately controlled. Single maintenance and reliever
  therapy combines an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist for controller
  and reliever treatments. This therapy is preferred for adults and adolescents because
  of its effectiveness in reducing severe exacerbations. Subcutaneous immunotherapy
  may be considered for those five years and older with mild to moderate allergic
  asthma; however, sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended. Patients with severe
  uncontrolled asthma despite appropriate treatment should be reassessed and considered
  for specialty referral. Biologic agents may be considered for patients with severe
  allergic and eosinophilic asthma.

# Chronic Asthma Treatment: Common Questions and Answers.

## Abstract

Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, and 62% of adults with asthma do not have adequately controlled symptoms. Asthma severity and level of control should be assessed at diagnosis and evaluated at subsequent visits using validated tools such as the Asthma Control Test or the asthma APGAR (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy) tools. Short-acting beta2 agonists are preferred asthma reliever medications. Controller medications consist of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Treatment typically begins with inhaled corticosteroids, and additional medications or dosage increases should be added in a stepwise fashion according to guideline-directed therapy recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program or the Global Initiative for Asthma when symptoms are inadequately controlled. Single maintenance and reliever therapy combines an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist for controller and reliever treatments. This therapy is preferred for adults and adolescents because of its effectiveness in reducing severe exacerbations. Subcutaneous immunotherapy may be considered for those five years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma; however, sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite appropriate treatment should be reassessed and considered for specialty referral. Biologic agents may be considered for patients with severe allergic and eosinophilic asthma.
