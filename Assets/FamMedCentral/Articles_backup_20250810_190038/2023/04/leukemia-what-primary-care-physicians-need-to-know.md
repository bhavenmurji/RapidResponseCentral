abstract: Leukemia is caused by an abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells
  in the bone marrow. The four general subtypes are acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous,
  chronic lymphocytic, and chronic myelogenous. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia primarily
  occurs in children, whereas the other subtypes are more common in adults. Risk factors
  include certain chemical and ionizing radiation exposures and genetic disorders.
  Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, and easy bruising
  or bleeding. Diagnosis is confirmed with bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood
  smear. Hematology-oncology referral is recommended in patients with suspected leukemia.
  Chemotherapy, radiation, targeted molecular therapy, monoclonal antibodies, or hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation are common treatments. Complications from treatment include
  serious infections from immunosuppression, tumor lysis syndrome, cardiovascular
  events, and hepatotoxicity. Long-term sequelae in leukemia survivors include secondary
  malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal and endocrine disorders.
  Five-year survival rates are highest in younger patients and those diagnosed with
  chronic myelogenous or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

## Abstract

Leukemia is caused by an abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. The four general subtypes are acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, chronic lymphocytic, and chronic myelogenous. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia primarily occurs in children, whereas the other subtypes are more common in adults. Risk factors include certain chemical and ionizing radiation exposures and genetic disorders. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, and easy bruising or bleeding. Diagnosis is confirmed with bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood smear. Hematology-oncology referral is recommended in patients with suspected leukemia. Chemotherapy, radiation, targeted molecular therapy, monoclonal antibodies, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are common treatments. Complications from treatment include serious infections from immunosuppression, tumor lysis syndrome, cardiovascular events, and hepatotoxicity. Long-term sequelae in leukemia survivors include secondary malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal and endocrine disorders. Five-year survival rates are highest in younger patients and those diagnosed with chronic myelogenous or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

## Relationships Matter: Primary Care Physicians and Usual Sources of Care

Alison N. Huffstetler, Anuradha Jetty, Ann Greiner, Yalda Jabbarpour

There are benefits to having a primary care physician or a usual source of care. Yet, the overall percentage of U.S. patients who reported having a usual source of care declined from 84% in 2000 to 74% in 2019, with wide variations across states, patient race, and insurance...
