Managing Selected Chronic Conditions in Hospitalized Patients Robert L.
Gauer, MD, Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina; Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland Alain Abellada, MD; Matthew Stewart, MD; and Ryan Kozloski, MD Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina The management of chronic illnesses should continue during hospitalization.
Some chronic conditions require immediate intervention, whereas intensification of therapy for other conditions may be delayed until after discharge.
Factors such as pain, anxiety, poor sleep hygiene, and concurrent illness can result in a transient elevation of blood pressure.
Acute lower- ing of blood pressure in hospitalized patients who do not have target-organ damage is not recommended and may lead to harm.
If treatment is needed, intravenous antihypertensive agents should be avoided.
Patients with diabetes mellitus require continued management of their blood glucose while hospitalized.
Noninsulin agents are typically discontinued.
Blood glu- cose levels should be managed using basal, prandial, and/or correction insulin.
During hospitalization, conservative blood glucose targets (140 to 180 mg per d L) are preferred vs. lower targets to reduce length of stay, mortality, and the risk of hypo- glycemic events in critically ill patients.
Alcohol use disorder is common and hospitalization for other conditions necessitates identification and management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
The mainstay of therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome is benzodiazepines; however, phenobarbital is an alternative treatment option.
The risk of venous thromboembolic disease is significantly increased for hospitalized patients.
Venous thromboprophylaxis is recommended for all but low-risk patients.
Pharmacologic prophylaxis with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is preferred; mechanical prophylaxis is an alternative for patients who are at high risk of bleeding or have contraindications to anticoagulation. (Am Fam Physician. 2024; 109(2): 134-142.
