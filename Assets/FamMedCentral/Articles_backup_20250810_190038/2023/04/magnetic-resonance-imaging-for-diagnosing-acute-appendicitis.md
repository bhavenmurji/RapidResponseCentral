## Electronic Cigarettes for Smoking Cessation

Because no data from a long-term safety profile are available, we have assigned a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) to this review, despite the promising certainty of evidence supporting nicotine e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Diagnosing Acute Appendicitis

In pregnant patients, children, and adults with clinical signs and symptoms of appendicitis, MRI has an overall sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 96%. The posttest probability of having appendicitis after a positive MRI is 90% and 2% after a negative MRI, assuming a...
