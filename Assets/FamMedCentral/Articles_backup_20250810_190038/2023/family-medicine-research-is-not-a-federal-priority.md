abstract: Research in family medicine produces clinical information and improves care delivery, but it has yet to receive
  equitable federal investment. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary funder of medical research in the United
  States. In 2021, the NIH received $45 billion.1 Between 2017 and 2021, the NIH spent only 0.2% of its budget on family medicine
  research (Figure 1). Although other funding organizations exist, the NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research, and
  because it continues to undervalue family medicine research, its underinvestment impacts clinical care.

## Abstract

Research in family medicine produces clinical information and improves care delivery, but it has yet to receive equitable federal investment. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary funder of medical research in the United States. In 2021, the NIH received $45 billion.1 Between 2017 and 2021, the NIH spent only 0.2% of its budget on family medicine research (Figure 1). Although other funding organizations exist, the NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research, and because it continues to undervalue family medicine research, its underinvestment impacts clinical care.
