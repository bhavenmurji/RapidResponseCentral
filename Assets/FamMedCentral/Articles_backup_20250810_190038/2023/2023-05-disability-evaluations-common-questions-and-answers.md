abstract: Disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits
  at least one major life activity. Family physicians are often asked to assess patients
  with disabling conditions that can impact insurance benefits, employment, and ability
  to access needed accommodations. Disability evaluations are needed for short-term
  work restrictions following a simple injury or illness and for more complex cases
  involving Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, Family
  and Medical Leave Act, workers' compensation, and personal/private disability insurance
  claims. Using a stepwise approach built on awareness of the biologic, psychological,
  and social elements of disability assessment may facilitate this evaluation. Step
  1 establishes the role of the physician in the disability evaluation process and
  the context of the request. In Step 2, the physician assesses impairments and establishes
  a diagnosis based on findings from an examination and validated diagnostic tools.
  In Step 3, the physician identifies specific participation restrictions by assessing
  the patient's ability to perform specific movements or activities and reviewing
  the employment environment and tasks. Steps 4 and 5 ensure proper documentation,
  billing, and coding. In complex cases, consultants such as psychiatrists and physical
  therapists may assist by providing insight into a patient's mental and physical
  impairments, activity limitations, and response to treatment.

## Abstract

Disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits at least one major life activity. Family physicians are often asked to assess patients with disabling conditions that can impact insurance benefits, employment, and ability to access needed accommodations. Disability evaluations are needed for short-term work restrictions following a simple injury or illness and for more complex cases involving Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, Family and Medical Leave Act, workers' compensation, and personal/private disability insurance claims. Using a stepwise approach built on awareness of the biologic, psychological, and social elements of disability assessment may facilitate this evaluation. Step 1 establishes the role of the physician in the disability evaluation process and the context of the request. In Step 2, the physician assesses impairments and establishes a diagnosis based on findings from an examination and validated diagnostic tools. In Step 3, the physician identifies specific participation restrictions by assessing the patient's ability to perform specific movements or activities and reviewing the employment environment and tasks. Steps 4 and 5 ensure proper documentation, billing, and coding. In complex cases, consultants such as psychiatrists and physical therapists may assist by providing insight into a patient's mental and physical impairments, activity limitations, and response to treatment.
