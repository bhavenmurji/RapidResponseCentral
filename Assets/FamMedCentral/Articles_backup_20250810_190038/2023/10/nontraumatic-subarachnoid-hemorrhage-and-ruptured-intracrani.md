abstract: Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured intracranial aneurysm is a
  neurosurgical emergency with a mortality rate of approximately 50%. Prompt identification
  and treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are paramount to reduce mortality,
  long-term morbidity, and health care burden for survivors. The prevalence of intracranial
  aneurysms is 2% to 6% of the global population, many of which are found incidentally
  during workup for an unrelated condition. Screening is not recommended for the general
  population and should be reserved for patients who have at least one family member
  with a history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage or when there
  is a high index of suspicion for those with certain medical conditions associated
  with an increased incidence of intracranial aneurysms. Physicians who treat patients
  with headache should be aware of the spectrum of clinical presentation of aneurysmal
  subarachnoid hemorrhage because not all patients present with the classic thunderclap
  headache. The Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule is a validated clinical decision
  tool to help determine which patients with a sudden, acute headache require imaging
  with noncontrast computed tomography. Based on the results of initial computed tomography
  and duration of symptoms, the patient may require a lumbar puncture or additional
  imaging to confirm the diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis of an aneurysmal subarachnoid
  hemorrhage is essential to patients receiving definitive treatment.
