abstract: The average salaries of female physicians are lower than those of their
  male peers. Previous studies demonstrate that female family physicians earn approximately
  16% less than their male counterparts.1 However, multiple studies have demonstrated
  benefits of having a female physician, including quality of care and relationships.2,3
  After controlling for multiple variables, the wage gap persists, making gender biases
  the most likely explanation.
