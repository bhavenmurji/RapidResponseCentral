abstract: High-quality research on the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter
  medications in pregnancy is limited. Physicians should explore nonpharmacologic
  treatments before recommending medication. For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy,
  vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), H1 antihistamines, and ginger are safe and effective. Physicians
  can recommend calcium carbonate, H2 antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors for
  gastroesophageal reflux disease. Osmotic laxatives, fiber preparations, and probiotics
  are safe and effective treatments for constipation. Many over-the-counter topical
  medications are safe in pregnancy due to low systemic absorption, but topical retinoids,
  such as adapalene, should be avoided. Hypertonic saline nasal rinse and antihistamines
  are safe, beneficial options for treating pregnancy-induced rhinitis, and intranasal
  corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit for chronic allergic rhinitis. The safety
  of acetaminophen for the treatment of headaches and low back pain during pregnancy
  has come into question with recent studies; therefore, judicious use is advised.
  Physicians should screen all pregnant patients for their risk of developing preeclampsia
  and initiate low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation until delivery for those
  at increased risk. Data are limited on the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements
  during pregnancy.
