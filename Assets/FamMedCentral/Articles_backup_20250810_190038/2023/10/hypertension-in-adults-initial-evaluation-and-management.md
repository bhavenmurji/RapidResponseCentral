abstract: Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease
  and the most common chronic condition seen by family physicians. Treatment of hypertension
  reduces morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction,
  heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The use of ambulatory and home
  blood pressure monitoring improves diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of adults with
  hypertension should focus on identifying complications of the condition and comorbid
  cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians should counsel all patients with elevated
  blood pressure about effective lifestyle interventions, including the Dietary Approaches
  to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, dietary sodium restriction, potassium enrichment,
  regular exercise, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption. First-line
  antihypertensive medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin
  receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Thresholds
  for pharmacologic intervention and blood pressure goals differ according to various
  guidelines. Evidence strongly supports reducing blood pressure to less than 140/90
  mm Hg to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults with
  hypertension. Lowering blood pressure to less than 135/85 mm Hg may further reduce
  the risk of myocardial infarction. Clinical judgment and shared decision-making
  should guide treatment of patients with mild hypertension and older adults who may
  be more susceptible to adverse effects of antihypertensive medications and tight
  blood pressure control.
