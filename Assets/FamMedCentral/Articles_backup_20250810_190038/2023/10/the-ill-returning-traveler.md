abstract: Approximately 1.8 billion people will cross an international border by 2030,
  and 66% of travelers will develop a travel-related illness. Most travel-related
  illnesses are self-limiting and do not require significant intervention; others
  could cause significant morbidity or mortality. Physicians should begin with a thorough
  history and clinical examination to have the highest probability of making the correct
  diagnosis. Targeted questioning should focus on the type of trip taken, the travel
  itinerary, and a list of all geographic locations visited. Inquiries should also
  be made about pretravel preparations, such as chemoprophylactic medications, vaccinations,
  and any personal protective measures such as insect repellents or specialized clothing.
  Travelers visiting friends and relatives are at a higher risk of travel-related
  illnesses and more severe infections. The two most common vaccine-preventable illnesses
  in travelers are influenza and hepatitis A. Most travel-related illnesses become
  apparent soon after arriving at home because incubation periods are rarely longer
  than four to six weeks. The most common illnesses in travelers from resource-rich
  to resource-poor locations are travelers diarrhea and respiratory infections. Localizing
  symptoms such as fever with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or skin-related concerns
  may aid in identifying the underlying etiology.
