## Abstract

Childhood and adolescent sports participation is encouraged because of health and wellness benefits. However, the increasing number of young athletes means there is the potential for more sports-related overuse injuries. Most youth sports injuries occur at the bone's relatively weaker growth centers: the epiphyses and apophyses. Little league shoulder and elbow are common overuse injuries in baseball and other single-arm dominant sports. Little league shoulder is a Salter-Harris fracture of the proximal humerus, and little league elbow is an apophysitis of the medial epicondyle. In both injuries, the athlete often reports decreased throwing velocity or accuracy. The physician should emphasize the Major League Baseball Pitch Smart guidelines when counseling on rehabilitation and prevention. Gymnast's wrist is a distal radial epiphysis injury in which the patient reports chronic wrist pain. Gymnast's wrist should be managed conservatively with immobilization. Spondylolysis is an important cause of overuse back pain in young athletes and can progress to spondylolisthesis. Patellofemoral pain syndrome presents with anterior knee pain, often made worse with running or descending stairs and improved with physical therapy. Osgood-Schlatter disease and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease are forms of knee apophysitis. Calcaneal apophysitis is a common cause of heel pain in young athletes and can be diagnosed clinically with the calcaneal squeeze test. Calcaneal apophysitis is treated conservatively, with good evidence for the use of heel cups and physical therapy.
