Van Wagoner, Ph D, FAHA, FHRS AIM: The “2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation” provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from Pub Med, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline.
Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate. *Writing committee members are required to recuse themselves from voting on sections to which their specific relationships with industry may apply; see Appendix 1 for detailed information. †ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines liaison. ‡ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Performance Measures liaison. §Lay stakeholder representative. ‖American College of Clinical Pharmacy representative. ¶Heart Rhythm Society representative. #Joint ACC/AHA staff representative. **ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Data Standards liaison.

Recommendations from the “2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” and the “2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians.
In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

Definitions Term Definition AF A supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation and ineffective atrial contraction Electrocardiographic characteristics include (1) irregular R-R intervals (when atrioventricular conduction is present), (2) absence of distinct P waves, and (3) irregular atrial activity also known as fibrillatory waves.
AF can be documented by, for example, 12-lead ECG, rhythm strips, wearables, intracardiac electrograms, but will always require visual confirmation that the diagnosis is accurate.
Clinical AF With the increasing availability of wearable devices and other continuous monitoring technologies, the distinction between clinical and subclinical AF has become increasingly blurred, thus the writing committee felt the term clinical AF has become less useful.
Yet, the term was kept because most of the evidence from randomized trials that have led to guideline recommendations for the treatment of AF refer to “clinical AF.” These trials required electrocardiographic documentation of the arrhythmia for inclusion and most patients presented for clinical evaluation and/or therapy of the arrhythmia.
Subclinical AF Subclinical AF refers to this arrhythmia identified in individuals who do not have symptoms attributable to AF and in whom there are no previous ECGs documenting AF This includes AF identified by implanted devices (pacemakers, defibrillators, or implantable loop recorders) or wearable monitors Atrial high-rate These are defined as atrial events exceeding the programmed detection rate limit set by the device.
These are recorded by implanted episodes devices but require visual inspection to confirm AF and exclude other atrial arrhythmias, artifact or oversensing.
AF burden AF burden encompasses both frequency and duration and refers to the amount of AF that an individual has.
AF burden has been defined differently across studies.
For the purpose of this guideline, AF burden will be defined as the durations of an an episode or as a percentage of AF duration during the monitoring period depending on how it was defined in the individual studies.
First detected AF The first documentation of AF, regardless of previous symptoms Paroxysmal AF AF that is intermittent and terminates within ≤7 d of onset Persistent AF AF that is continuous and sustains for >7 d and requires intervention.
Of note, patients with persistent AF who, with therapy, become parox- ysmal should still be defined as persistent as this reflects their original pattern and is more useful to predict outcomes and define substrate.
Long-standing AF that is continuous for >12 mo in duration persistent AF Permanent AF A term that is used when the patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm Acceptance of AF represents a therapeutic decision and does not represent an inherent pathophysiological attribute of AF Terms considered obsolete Chronic AF This historical term has had variable definitions and should be abandoned.
It has been replaced by the “paroxysmal,” “persistent,” “long- standing persistent,” and “permanent” terminology.
Valvular and The distinction between “valvular” and “nonvalvular “AF remains a matter of debate.
Their definitions may be confusing.
Recent trials nonvalvular AF comparing vitamin K antagonists with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in AF were performed among patients with so-called “nonvalvular” AF.
These trials have all allowed native valvular heart disease other than mitral stenosis (mostly moderate and severe) and prosthetic heart valves to be included.
We should no longer consider the classification of AF as ‘‘valvular’’ or “nonvalvular” for the purpose of defining the etiology of AF, since the term was specific for eligibility of stroke risk reduction therapies.
Valvular and nonvalvular terminology should be abandoned.
Lone AF This term has been used in the past to identify AF in younger patients without structural heart disease who are at a lower risk for thromboembolism.
This term does not enhance patient care, is not currently used, and should be abandoned.
