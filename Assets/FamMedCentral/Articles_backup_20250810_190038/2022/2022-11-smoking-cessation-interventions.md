abstract: In the United States, 1 in 5 adults uses tobacco products. Cigarette smoking
  is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite
  its known health effects. Although nearly one-half of people who smoke try to quit
  each year, only up to 1 in 20 who quit without support achieve abstinence for at
  least six months. All patients, including school-aged children and adolescents,
  should be asked if they smoke and offered evidence-based treatments for smoking
  cessation. Use of the 5 A's framework (ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) can
  help clinicians promote smoking cessation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that
  combining pharmacotherapy with effective behavior strategies is significantly more
  effective than either approach alone. Pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food
  and Drug Administration for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy,
  bupropion, and varenicline. Extended use (greater than 12 weeks) of a controller
  therapy (varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patch) is associated with significantly
  higher sustained quit rates and lower relapse rates than standard use (six to 12
  weeks). e-Cigarettes are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
  smoking cessation, and evidence supporting their benefit is inconclusive. Lung cancer
  screening is recommended for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year
  smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Lung
  cancer screening should be combined with smoking cessation tools and treatment.

## Abstract

In the United States, 1 in 5 adults uses tobacco products. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite its known health effects. Although nearly one-half of people who smoke try to quit each year, only up to 1 in 20 who quit without support achieve abstinence for at least six months. All patients, including school-aged children and adolescents, should be asked if they smoke and offered evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation. Use of the 5 A's framework (ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) can help clinicians promote smoking cessation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that combining pharmacotherapy with effective behavior strategies is significantly more effective than either approach alone. Pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline. Extended use (greater than 12 weeks) of a controller therapy (varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patch) is associated with significantly higher sustained quit rates and lower relapse rates than standard use (six to 12 weeks). e-Cigarettes are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation, and evidence supporting their benefit is inconclusive. Lung cancer screening is recommended for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Lung cancer screening should be combined with smoking cessation tools and treatment.
