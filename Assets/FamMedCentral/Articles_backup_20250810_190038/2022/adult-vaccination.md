### Main Content


Adult vaccination rates are low in the United States, despite clear benefits for reducing morbidity and mortality. Vaccine science is evolving rapidly, and family physicians must maintain familiarity with the most recent guidelines. The recommended adult immunization schedule is updated annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All eligible patients should receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the current guidelines. Adults without contraindications should also receive an annual influenza vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for adults with specific risk factors. All pregnant patients, adults younger than 60 years, and those 60 years and older who have risk factors should receive a hepatitis B vaccine. A 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all patients who are 65 years and older. Patients who receive 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later. Adults 19 to 64 years of age should receive a pneumococcal vaccination if they have medical risk factors. A single dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive immunity, and additional doses are recommended for patients with HIV and postdelivery for pregnant patients who are not immune to rubella. A tetanus and diphtheria toxoids booster is recommended every 10 years. For pregnant patients and those in close contact with young infants, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine should be administered. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended for all people through 26 years of age. Herpes zoster vaccine is indicated for all adults 50 years and older. .

Vaccination rates for adults in the United States have not met public health goals; consequently, vaccine-preventable diseases are widespread. Less than optimal vaccination rates may be attributed to variations in perspectives about vaccinations based on cultural and religious beliefs, race, and socioeconomic status.1 Family physicians can positively influence vaccination uptake by educating, reassuring, and recommending vaccination to patients.2 Patient education is important because of the growth of the antivaccination movement.3

Vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive bacterial or viral antigen to the body, which starts an immune response through the production of immunoglobulin G and A antibodies. These antibodies bind to the antigen, triggering CD8 T cells to clear infected cells and begin the development of memory CD8 T cells.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination schedule provides updated guidance on vaccine recommendations. Table 1 summarizes the recommendations for vaccines discussed in this article.4 The full CDC vaccination schedule is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/adult.html.

Insurance coverage for vaccines differs by payor. Beginning in January 2023, all Medicare Part D plans will be required to cover adult vaccines recommended by ACIP with no cost sharing, even if the beneficiary is in the deductible phase of benefits. Medicaid will implement a similar requirement beginning in October 2023.

Three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and approved in the United States. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain a single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, which is transcribed by white blood T cells into a protein antigen that triggers an immune response.5 This type of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was developed based on mRNA technology used in vaccines for Zika virus infections, HIV-1, influenza, and solid organ tumors.6 The Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine is a viral vector vaccine. Due to the risk of adverse events, including thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine is no longer preferred.7

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have shown high effectiveness. Clinicians should administer an mRNA SARSCoV-2 vaccine to eligible patients to decrease the risk of hospitalization and death.8,9 Two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine decreases the need for hospital care by up to 77% in patients who are immunocompromised and up to 90% in patients who are immunocompetent.10

As a result of the emergence of the Omicron strain, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) no longer authorizes booster doses of the original monovalent Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for adults. New bivalent Pfizer and Moderna booster vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the FDA. As of September 8, 2022, the CDC recommends that a single booster dose of either of the new bivalent COVID-19 vaccines be administered to adults at least two months after completing a primary two-dose vaccine series with either of the original monovalent vaccines or having received a booster dose with one of the monovalent vaccines.11

As a result of the evolution in the timing and frequency of additional boosters and potential changes in antigen components when different COVID-19 variants emerge, clinicians should monitor updates on the CDC and the FDA websites about these and other vaccines (Table 2).

Influenza vaccines can be classified as inactivated, live attenuated, or recombinant (Table 3).12 The latter is produced with an influenza DNA sequence inserted into a baculovirus (rather than using chicken eggs).12 That virus then produces the antigen for the vaccine. All influenza vaccines are quadrivalent vaccines designed to protect against two influenza A and two influenza B viruses.13

The CDC provides guidance about which type of vaccine should be used based on age and contraindications. Therefore, one vaccine may be preferred over others for individual patients.14 People with an egg allergy of any severity can receive any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine. People with severe reactions can be vaccinated under the supervision of a health care professional.15

The ACIP recommends that all patients six months and older who do not have contraindications receive routine annual influenza vaccination.4 Systematic reviews have found that influenza vaccines can reduce the proportion of adults, including older adults, who develop influenza illness by about one-half (2.3% risk in healthy unvaccinated adults vs. 1% in vaccinated adults).16,17

Hepatitis A vaccination (Havrix, Vaqta) is recommended for adults when specific risk factors are present (Table 4).18 Hepatitis A vaccination should also be administered to adults within two weeks of a known exposure.19 A combination vaccine with hepatitis B (Twinrix) can be administered when both vaccines are indicated for travelers to areas with endemic diseases, patients with hepatitis C or chronic liver disease, and other individuals who are at high risk.

Hepatitis B vaccines are recombinant single- or multiple-antigen vaccines. The multiple-antigen vaccines (Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, Twinrix) can be administered as a three-dose series at zero, one, and six months. The HepB-CpG vaccine (Heplisav-B) is a single-antigen vaccine using a novel immune-stimulatory sequence adjuvant that can be administered in two doses, four weeks apart.20

All pregnant patients and adults younger than 60 years should be vaccinated for hepatitis B. Although hepatitis B vaccines can safely be administered to patients 60 years and older, it is specifically recommended for those in that age group who are at risk of infection (i.e., chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexual exposure risk, injection drug use, risk of exposure, incarceration, or travel to areas with a high or intermediate endemic virus). Hepatitis B vaccines should not be administered to those who have had an allergic reaction to yeast or neomycin.21

Four pneumococcal vaccines are licensed in the United States for adults: 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; Prevnar 13), 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15; Vaxneuvance), 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20; Prevnar 20), and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax 23).22 PCV13 is no longer part of the current immunization schedule for adults.

It is recommended that adults 65 years and older who have not previously received a PCV should receive one dose of PCV15 or PCV20. If PCV15 is administered, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23 after one year; however, the interval can be shortened to eight weeks for individuals with immunocompromising conditions, cerebral spinal fluid leak, or cochlear implant.22,23 If PCV20 is used for the first pneumococcal immunization, a subsequent dose of PPSV23 is not indicated.

Vaccination with one dose of PCV15 or PCV20 is recommended for adults 19 to 64 years of age with medical risk factors, including chronic heart, lung, or liver disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; or cigarette smoking; and patients with immunocompromising conditions. If PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. If PCV20 is used, subsequent administration of PPSV23 is not indicated. In adults with risk factors who have received PPSV23 alone, PCV20 or PCV15 may be administered after at least one year.24

The live, attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive or confirmed evidence of immunity. Such evidence includes documentation of receiving one or more doses of a measles-containing vaccine for adults not at high risk or two doses for adults at high risk (e.g., health care workers, college students, international travelers), laboratory evidence of immunity, or birth before 1957.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is recommended for non-pregnant patients of childbearing age without presumptive or confirmed immunity to rubella. Two doses are recommended for patients with HIV.4 Among those who have completed the two-dose MMR series, a third dose of the vaccine decreases the risk of subsequent infection during an outbreak.25 If a patient is found to be rubella nonimmune during pregnancy, a booster dose of MMR is recommended postdelivery.
