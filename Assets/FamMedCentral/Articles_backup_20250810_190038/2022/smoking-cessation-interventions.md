### Main Content


In the United States, 1 in 5 adults uses tobacco products. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite its known health effects. Although nearly one-half of people who smoke try to quit each year, only up to 1 in 20 who quit without support achieve abstinence for at least six months. All patients, including school-aged children and adolescents, should be asked if they smoke and offered evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation. Use of the 5 A’s framework (ask, advise, assess, assist, arrange) can help clinicians promote smoking cessation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that combining pharmacotherapy with effective behavior strategies is significantly more effective than either approach alone. Pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline. Extended use (greater than 12 weeks) of a controller therapy (varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patch) is associated with significantly higher sustained quit rates and lower relapse rates than standard use (six to 12 weeks). e-Cigarettes are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for smoking cessation, and evidence supporting their benefit is inconclusive. Lung cancer screening is recommended for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Lung cancer screening should be combined with smoking cessation tools and treatment.

In the United States, 1 in 5 adults uses tobacco products. Cigarettes and other forms of combustible tobacco products (cigars and pipes) account for 80.5% of tobacco use.1 Despite the known health effects of cigarettes, smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States.1

Almost one-half of people who smoke try to quit each year; however, only up to 1 in 20 of those who quit without support achieve abstinence for at least six months. Brief discussions with clinicians can increase cessation rates by two-thirds, and more intensive treatment doubles the chances of quitting.2

Including smoking status with the vital sign assessment has not resulted in increased smoking cessation rates. Despite doubling the documentation of patient smoking status from 38% to 78%, clinicians are not addressing smoking more often.3 Studies have shown that clinicians who are trained in smoking cessation and knowledgeable about local resources are more likely to provide smoking cessation interventions.4 Therefore, clinician training and engagement are important variables in smoking cessation interventions.

The American Academy of Family Physician’s (AAFP’s) Ask and Act Tobacco Cessation Program provides free resources and tools to aid physicians (https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/care-resources/tobacco-and-nicotine/ask-act.html). All patients should be asked if they smoke, regardless of age, sex, or medical history. This includes school-aged children and adolescents because more than one-half of adult smokers start smoking daily before 18 years of age.5,6

The U.S. Public Health Service suggests using the 5 A’s framework (ask each patient about tobacco use, advise cessation, assess readiness to quit, assist tobacco users in quitting, arrange follow-up visits) in the outpatient setting5 (Table 15–9). Acknowledging that clinicians may not have adequate time and may not feel comfortable treating tobacco use disorders, simplified models such as AAR (ask, advise, refer to treatment resources) or AAC (ask, advise, connect patients to a quitline via fax, phone, or electronic referral) can be used.4

For record keeping and revenue purposes, it is important to correctly code smoking screening and counseling services (Table 210). In electronic health records, these codes can also be linked to patient resources or clinician tools for local, up-to-date treatments and referrals.

All nonpregnant adults who smoke cigarettes should be offered pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, especially patients who meet the criteria for nicotine dependence.2 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends pharmacotherapy, alone or combined with behavior strategies, for smoking cessation, and the AAFP supports this recommendation.6,11 Clinical studies have demonstrated that combining pharmacotherapy with behavior strategies significantly improves quit success compared with usual care or minimal intervention.6,12 Adding behavior support to pharmacotherapy is more effective than pharmacotherapy alone.6,13

There are seven pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for smoking cessation: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of a transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray; bupropion; and varenicline (Chantix). These therapies are identified as controllers or relievers based on their duration of action. Controllers (i.e., bupropion, varenicline, and nicotine patch) help reduce the impulse to smoke, whereas relievers (short-acting NRTs) aid in managing acute cravings. Table 3 summarizes FDA-approved therapies for smoking cessation.8,14,15

Traditionally, treatment with pharmacotherapies has been limited to 12 weeks. However, an American Thoracic Society (ATS) systematic review of eight studies demonstrated that extended use of a controller therapy for greater than 12 weeks leads to significantly higher sustained quit rates and lower relapse rates compared with standard use of six to 12 weeks, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 19 for one additional patient achieving abstinence at one year.9 The ATS recommends extended use of controller pharmacotherapies for up to one year for smoking cessation.9 A 2021 randomized controlled trial did not find improved abstinence with extended use of varenicline.16

Although medications have been traditionally restricted to individuals ready to quit, there is evidence that varenicline is effective for smoking cessation even in patients who are reluctant to quit.9 This indicates that varenicline, and possibly pharmacotherapy in general, plays an important role in disrupting the neurobiologic pathways that promote nicotine dependence and helps empower patients to quit. The ATS strongly recommends that physicians offer varenicline to patients with nicotine dependence even before they have expressed readiness to quit because this increases cessation at six months (NNT = 6).9

NRT is designed to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by stabilizing the patient’s nicotine dose to approximate intake and then gradually reducing the dose, without the associated toxins found in cigarettes. The dose needed to mitigate symptoms can be estimated based on the patient’s average cigarette use. One cigarette contains approximately 2 mg of nicotine. The transdermal patch is the only long-acting NRT; the gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray are short-acting.2

Although smokers traditionally start NRT on their quit date, some evidence supports increased abstinence rates if NRT is started before the quit date.4,9 Patients taking any form of NRT are 55% more likely to sustain smoking cessation for at least six months (NNT = 17) compared with placebo or no NRT.17 Using a combination of long- and short-acting NRTs increases the quit rate by 25% over a single form and is recommended for all nonpregnant adult smokers, especially heavy smokers.6,13,18

Common adverse effects of NRT include headache, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and sleep disturbance. NRT dependence is uncommon and outweighed by the overall benefits of smoking cessation.5 Side effect profiles by type of NRT are detailed in Table 3.8,14,15 Some NRTs are available over the counter, and some are prescription only.

Bupropion was the first non–nicotine-based pharmacotherapy approved for smoking cessation. Initially designed and marketed as an antidepressant, bupropion acts by weakly inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and partially blocking nicotine receptors, which reduce nicotine cravings.2,4,14,15,19 Bupropion is associated with a 64% higher likelihood of sustained smoking cessation (NNT = 14) compared with placebo or no pharmacotherapy, which is similar to the effectiveness of NRT.4,19 There is insufficient evidence to indicate whether the combination of bupropion and NRT is more effective than NRT alone.19

Varenicline is a partial agonist of the alpha4-beta2 nicotine receptor that reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms and blocks the rewarding effect of nicotine.2,4,9 Patients taking varenicline are 2.2 times more likely to achieve sustained smoking cessation compared with placebo.13,20 Varenicline is the most effective FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, with an NNT of 7 for abstinence at six months compared with bupropion and NRT.6,9,13,19,20

The ATS strongly recommends varenicline over bupropion and NRT.9 The ATS also conditionally recommends using varenicline plus a nicotine patch over varenicline alone, noting a 36% increase in sustained cessation rates and an NNT of 10 for six-month abstinence compared with varenicline alone. However, a 2021 randomized controlled trial did not show any difference between combining the nicotine patch with varenicline and using varenicline alone.16 There are no studies evaluating the combination of varenicline and short-acting NRTs.9 Evidence is insufficient to recommend the combination of bupropion and varenicline.19

Cytisine (Tabex) is a nicotine partial agonist that is licensed for use only in a few countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Two small trials suggest that cytisine leads to improved long-term abstinence without significant adverse events, although the evidence is low quality.20 Nortriptyline (Pamelor) titrated up to 75 to 100 mg per day and then taken for 12 weeks doubles the chance of quitting compared with placebo but may not be beneficial when added to NRT.21 Clonidine is less effective for smoking cessation than NRT, bupropion, and varenicline, and is associated with a dose-related increase in adverse events.21

Table 4 lists nonpharmacologic interventions for smoking cessation.22–40 The choice of interventions should be based on shared decision-making that includes patient preference and experience with previous quit attempts. Combining effective behavior interventions with pharmacotherapy improves cessation rates.13

e-Cigarettes are not FDA-approved tobacco cessation aids. However, people who want to quit smoking often use them.41,42 Pooled data from multiple studies showed that the use of e-cigarettes containing nicotine increases smoking cessation at six months (NNT = 25) compared with both NRT and e-cigarettes without nicotine.43 In contrast, a 2022 observational cohort study found that e-cigarette use results in a higher rate of smoking at 12 months (number needed to harm = 13).44 Switching from cigarette to e-cigarette dependency is a concern; continued use of e-cigarettes was as high as 80% in one study.43 In children and adolescents, the use of e-cigarettes increases probability, frequency, and intensity of combustible tobacco use.45 The USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, citing insufficient evidence and the need for ongoing studies.6
