abstract: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are common mental
  health conditions in adults that are often seen in primary care. Although there
  is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for PD and GAD, evaluation
  should be considered in patients who express recurrent, pervasive worry or present
  with somatic symptoms not attributed to underlying medical conditions. The GAD-7
  and Patient Health Questionnaire for PD are validated screening tools that can aid
  in diagnosis and assessment. Anxiety disorders often present with substance use
  disorders, which should be treated concurrently. Effective therapies for PD and
  GAD include cognitive behavior therapy and anti-depressants, including selective
  serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
  Benzodiazepines are not recommended for first-line therapy or long-term use because
  of adverse reactions, risk of dependence, and higher mortality. No consistent evidence
  currently supports a specific prevention strategy for PD or GAD, but exercise may
  be beneficial.

# Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder in Adults.

**Authors:** DeGeorge, Katharine C, Grover, Molly, Streeter, Gregory S

## Abstract

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are common mental health conditions in adults that are often seen in primary care. Although there is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for PD and GAD, evaluation should be considered in patients who express recurrent, pervasive worry or present with somatic symptoms not attributed to underlying medical conditions. The GAD-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire for PD are validated screening tools that can aid in diagnosis and assessment. Anxiety disorders often present with substance use disorders, which should be treated concurrently. Effective therapies for PD and GAD include cognitive behavior therapy and anti-depressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Benzodiazepines are not recommended for first-line therapy or long-term use because of adverse reactions, risk of dependence, and higher mortality. No consistent evidence currently supports a specific prevention strategy for PD or GAD, but exercise may be beneficial.
