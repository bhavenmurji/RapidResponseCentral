abstract: Acute pancreatitis is the most common gastrointestinal-related reason for
  hospitalization in the United States. It is diagnosed based on the revised Atlanta
  classification, with the presence of at least two of three criteria (upper abdominal
  pain, serum amylase or lipase level greater than three times the upper limit of
  normal, or characteristic findings on imaging studies). Although computed tomography
  and other imaging studies can be useful to assess severity or if the diagnosis is
  uncertain, imaging is not required to diagnose acute pancreatitis. Based on limited
  studies, several scoring systems have comparable effectiveness for predicting disease
  severity. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome on day 1 of hospital
  admission is highly sensitive in predicting severe disease. Treatment of acute pancreatitis
  involves goal-directed fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and oral feedings as tolerated
  on admission. If oral feedings are not tolerated, nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings
  are preferred over parenteral nutrition. Cholecystectomy is recommended during the
  initial admission for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. Medical management
  is usually sufficient for necrotizing pancreatitis; however, if surgical intervention
  is needed, a minimally invasive approach is advised over direct endoscopic or open
  surgical debridement (necrosectomy) because of lower complication rates.

# Acute Pancreatitis: Rapid Evidence Review.

## Abstract

Acute pancreatitis is the most common gastrointestinal-related reason for hospitalization in the United States. It is diagnosed based on the revised Atlanta classification, with the presence of at least two of three criteria (upper abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase level greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic findings on imaging studies). Although computed tomography and other imaging studies can be useful to assess severity or if the diagnosis is uncertain, imaging is not required to diagnose acute pancreatitis. Based on limited studies, several scoring systems have comparable effectiveness for predicting disease severity. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome on day 1 of hospital admission is highly sensitive in predicting severe disease. Treatment of acute pancreatitis involves goal-directed fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and oral feedings as tolerated on admission. If oral feedings are not tolerated, nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings are preferred over parenteral nutrition. Cholecystectomy is recommended during the initial admission for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis. Medical management is usually sufficient for necrotizing pancreatitis; however, if surgical intervention is needed, a minimally invasive approach is advised over direct endoscopic or open surgical debridement (necrosectomy) because of lower complication rates.
