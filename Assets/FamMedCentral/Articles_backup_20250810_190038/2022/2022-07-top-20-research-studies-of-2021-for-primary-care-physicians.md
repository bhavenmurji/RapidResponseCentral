abstract: 'This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2021 identified
  as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) that did not address the COVID-19
  pandemic. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1
  receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients
  with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
  Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes.
  Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an
  A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for
  hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with
  chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine,
  and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction
  in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is
  no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment
  of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality
  evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction.
  For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg,
  without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial
  evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For
  chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements,
  magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms
  carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia
  or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain,
  change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary
  prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81
  mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled
  Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years,
  no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated.
  Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful
  improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression,
  initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first
  eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with
  iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children
  with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing
  education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in
  4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic.'

## Abstract

This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2021 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) that did not address the COVID-19 pandemic. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes. Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine, and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg, without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements, magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81 mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years, no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression, initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in 4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic.
