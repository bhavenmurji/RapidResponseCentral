## Abstract

Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

## Key Recommendations for Practice

- The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a prior clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 with ongoing symptoms. A prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection is not required.
- Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, most of which are common presentations in primary care.
- The most common symptoms after six months are fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction.
- An individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity program is recommended for patients with fatigue or postexertional malaise.
- Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to COVID-19, evidence for their use is insufficient.

## Introduction

This article summarizes the best available evidence for the diagnosis and management of postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also called long COVID, in adults. Proposed etiologies for long COVID include residual damage from acute infection, ongoing viral activity within an intrahost viral reservoir, complications from a hyperinflammatory state, immune dysfunction, and unmasking of preexisting health conditions.

## Epidemiology

Data show that long COVID affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 19% of adults who had COVID-19 in the past are still experiencing symptoms.

Reliable data on long COVID in children are lacking.

Illness from COVID-19 has immediate and long-term consequences that can be conceptualized in three phases. Patients do not routinely develop all three:

- **Phase 1:** An acute illness with varying degrees of severity caused by viral replication and initial immune response lasts days to weeks. Asymptomatic patients can also progress to later phases of the illness.

- **Phase 2:** A rare hyperinflammatory illness known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome may occur two to five weeks after onset of the infection. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome can affect children and adults and is caused by a dysregulated immune response with signs and symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease.

- **Phase 3:** Long COVID may develop and can last for months.

### Risk Factors

A 2022 study identified type 2 diabetes mellitus, SARS-CoV-2 viremia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific autoantibodies as risk factors for long COVID. Additional risk factors suggested by other studies include:
- Age older than 50 years
- Female sex
- More severe acute infection
- More than five symptoms in the first week of acute infection
- Immunosuppressive conditions
- Underlying health conditions (e.g., hypertension, obesity, psychiatric condition)
- Partial or no vaccination

In a large community-based sample, the risk of long COVID in fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough COVID-19 is less than in partially or unvaccinated individuals.

Patients with long COVID report decreased quality of life on standardized testing.

## Diagnosis

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days, whereas the World Health Organization defines long COVID as symptoms that last for at least two months.

The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a prior clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 with ongoing symptoms. A prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection is not required. People with COVID-19 may have been asymptomatic or may not have had access to testing, and 10% to 20% do not produce detectable antibodies.

The differential diagnosis includes:
- Acute sequelae of COVID-19
- Previous comorbidities
- Unmasking of preexisting health conditions
- Reinfection
- New acute concerns
- Complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation

### Clinical Evaluation

Review of the patient's medical history should assess for conditions that could impact severity of COVID-19, including asthma, chronic fatigue, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart conditions, pulmonary disease, mood disorders, and trauma.

Physicians should advise patients that long COVID is not fully understood and be sensitive to patient concerns that symptoms could be misattributed to psychiatric causes.

### Signs and Symptoms

Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, most of which are common presentations in primary care. Presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit.

Common symptoms include:
- Abdominal pain
- Anosmia
- Chest pain
- Cognitive impairment (brain fog)
- Dizziness
- Dyspnea
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Insomnia
- Mood changes
- Palpitations
- Paresthesias
- Postexertional malaise

The severity of these symptoms may not be consistent with objective findings.

#### Symptom Timeline

A comprehensive review of symptom prevalence and trajectory found that:
- In patients who recovered within 90 days, symptoms peaked during the second week
- In patients who did not recover before 90 days, symptoms peaked at two months
- The most common symptoms after six months are fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction
- 85.9% of patients with symptoms lasting for more than six months experienced relapses, triggered mainly by physical activity, stress, exercise, or mental activity

#### Postexertional Malaise

Postexertional malaise, a hallmark of long COVID, is a disabling, often delayed exhaustion disproportionate to the effort exerted. It is characterized by improvement followed by severe exhaustion and worsening of symptoms requiring several days or weeks of recovery. Similar to other relapsing symptoms, postexertional malaise can be triggered by routine physical activities (e.g., bathing), cognitive activities, and emotional stress. The onset of symptoms is often delayed (12 to 72 hours after activity) with unpredictable severity. Postexertional malaise is distinct from fatigue, which is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy.

The fatigue experienced in long COVID is often multifactorial and may appear similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome). Myalgic encephalomyelitis is a complex, severe, multisystem syndrome characterized by postexertional malaise that often follows a viral illness. Although patients with long COVID can meet criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis, more data are needed to better understand if fatigue related to long COVID represents a distinct process or is a manifestation of myalgic encephalomyelitis.

#### Autonomic Dysfunction

Autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia) such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) commonly occurs in long COVID and may include:
- Abdominal pain and bloating
- Blurry or tunnel vision
- Constipation or loose stools
- Dizziness
- Fatigue
- Labile blood pressures
- Light-headedness
- Orthostatic intolerance
- Palpitations
- Peripheral vasoconstriction
- Nausea
- Night sweats
- Tachycardia
- Temperature intolerance

### Diagnostic Testing

A basic laboratory panel should be obtained to identify treatable conditions, including:
- Complete blood count
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- C-reactive protein
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- Ferritin
- Thyroid stimulating hormone
- Vitamin D
- Vitamin B12

Further diagnostic testing is guided by specific history and physical examination findings, persistence and severity of symptoms, the possibility of other post-COVID complications, and a shared understanding of the risks and benefits.

Although laboratory and diagnostic test results are commonly normal in patients with long COVID, clinicians should not disregard the impact of symptoms on a patient's daily functioning, quality of life, and ability to return to school or work.

## Treatment

Treatment recommendations for long COVID are based on expert opinion and consensus guidelines in the absence of clinical trials. The goal of treatment is to optimize function and improve quality of life.

A comprehensive plan of care requires a whole-patient perspective representative of the patient's presenting symptoms, underlying conditions, psychological well-being, personal and social situations, and treatment goals.

### Activity Management

An individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity program is recommended for patients with fatigue or postexertional malaise. This is different from graded exercise therapy, which is controversial in the management of myalgic encephalomyelitis. Before initiating a program, patients should be assessed for fatigue patterns throughout the day and advised to avoid activities that trigger postexertional malaise. The appropriate range of activities used in the program is highly dependent on the patient. Guidelines also recommend assessing a patient's response to initiating and escalating activities.

### Cognitive Impairment

Patients with cognitive impairment as a result of long COVID should be referred to a specialist with expertise in formal cognitive assessment and remediation (e.g., neuropsychologist, speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist). Clinicians should address polypharmacy and, if possible, discontinue medications that may impact cognition.

### Respiratory Symptoms

Patients with ongoing cough and dyspnea may benefit from:
- Breathing exercises that focus on optimal body position and posture
- Pulmonary rehabilitation for pulmonary disease
- A phased return to activity program

### Dysautonomia Management

The recommended treatment for dysautonomia (e.g., POTS) includes dietary and behavior modifications such as:
- Ensuring fluid and salt repletion
- Wearing compression garments
- Performing isometric exercises
- Eating small, more frequent meals
- Implementing physical reconditioning programs in nonupright positions (when stable)
- Avoiding exacerbating factors (e.g., alcohol use, warm environments)

For symptoms of dysautonomia that persist despite conservative measures, first-line pharmacologic agents include propranolol, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, and midodrine. Patients with POTS are highly sensitive to the effects of medical management, and the lowest dose should be used first.

### Other Symptom Management

Recommended initial treatments for symptoms suggestive of mast cell activation syndrome (anxiety, conjunctivitis, hypotension, palpitations, rashes, rhinitis, sore throat, urticaria, and wheezing) include H1 and H2 histamine antagonists, cromolyn, and leukotriene inhibitors.

Many presenting symptoms and conditions associated with long COVID are commonly seen in primary care practice and can be managed using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Examples include renal disease, chronic pain, hyperglycemia, insomnia, mood disorders, paresthesias, pulmonary infections, small fiber neuropathy, and thromboembolism.

### Medications for Fatigue

Several medications commonly used to treat fatigue in other conditions (e.g., myalgic encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, cancer) have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to COVID-19, including modafinil (Provigil), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and amantadine. However, evidence for this use is insufficient.

### Follow-up Care

Follow-up visits are patient-specific but can be considered every two to three months. Although an in-person visit may have advantages for physiologic evaluation and other assessments, telemedicine approaches with phone calls or virtual visits can be helpful for follow-up and lessen the burden on patients.

## Lifestyle and Behavior Interventions

Energy conservation strategies such as the four P's framework (planning, pacing, prioritizing, positioning) and the stop, rest, pace strategy, and avoiding relapsing triggers may help patients mitigate fatigue.

Patients should be supported in maintaining:
- Adequate hydration
- A healthy diet
- Information on peer support resources

Structured coordination of care and connection to social services can benefit vulnerable populations with long COVID.

## Referral, Consultation, and Hospitalization

Primary care clinicians can manage most patients with long COVID, but almost every state has specialized clinics that can be used for more complex cases. Physicians can find post-COVID care centers in their state at https://www.survivorcorps.com/pccc.

Specialty referral should be considered if:
- Initial treatment is unsuccessful
- For complex or severe presentations
- For new concerning findings on imaging or other studies

## Prognosis

Most patients can expect gradual improvement in functional status with a relapsing and remitting course, aided by careful pacing, prioritization, and goal setting. Although many individuals may experience resolution of some or all symptoms over time, the ultimate long-term prognosis of long COVID is unclear.

Clinicians should set expectations for patients, advising that there are varying outcomes and rates of recovery.

One study found a progressive decline in the average number of symptoms after seven months; however, 65.2% of patients still had symptoms after six months. Those with continued postexertional malaise experienced a higher number of average symptoms.

Most individuals with long-term breathing difficulties do not develop permanent or chronic lung injury. Most people will gradually recover from cognitive impairment after a severe illness.

## Disability Considerations

Long COVID is now a recognized disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act, sections 504 and 1557.
