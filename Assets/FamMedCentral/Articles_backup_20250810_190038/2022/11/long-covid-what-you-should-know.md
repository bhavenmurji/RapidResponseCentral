Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

This article summarizes the best available evidence for the diagnosis and management of postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also called long COVID, in adults. Proposed etiologies for long COVID include residual damage from acute infection, ongoing viral activity within an intrahost viral reservoir, complications from a hyperinflammatory state, immune dysfunction, and unmasking of preexisting health conditions.1,2

Data show that long COVID affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19.3,4 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 19% of adults who had COVID-19 in the past are still experiencing symptoms.5

Illness from COVID-19 has immediate and long-term consequences that can be conceptualized in three phases. Patients do not routinely develop all three.7

○ Phase 1. An acute illness with varying degrees of severity caused by viral replication and initial immune response lasts days to weeks. Asymptomatic patients can also progress to later phases of the illness.7

○ Phase 2. A rare hyperinflammatory illness known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome may occur two to five weeks after onset of the infection.7–10 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome can affect children and adults and is caused by a dysregulated immune response with signs and symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease.7,8

A 2022 study identified type 2 diabetes mellitus, SARS-CoV-2 viremia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific autoantibodies as risk factors for long COVID.11 Additional risk factors suggested by other studies include age older than 50 years, female sex, more severe acute infection, more than five symptoms in the first week of acute infection, immunosuppressive conditions, underlying health conditions (e.g., hypertension, obesity, psychiatric condition), and partial or no vaccination.12–17

In a large community-based sample, the risk of long COVID in fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough COVID-19 is less than in partially or unvaccinated individuals.14,18

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days,18 whereas the World Health Organization defines long COVID as symptoms that last for at least two months.19

The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a prior clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 with ongoing symptoms. A prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection is not required.1 People with COVID-19 may have been asymptomatic or may not have had access to testing, and 10% to 20% do not produce detectable antibodies.1,20,21

The differential diagnosis includes acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfection, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation.1,15,22

Review of the patient’s medical history should assess for conditions that could impact severity of COVID-19, including asthma, chronic fatigue, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart conditions, pulmonary disease, mood disorders, and trauma.1

Physicians should advise patients that long COVID is not fully understood and be sensitive to patient concerns that symptoms could be misattributed to psychiatric causes.1

Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, most of which are common presentations in primary care.1,23,24

Common symptoms include abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, dizziness, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise (Table 117,25–27). The severity of these symptoms may not be consistent with objective findings.1

A comprehensive review of symptom prevalence and trajectory found that in patients who recovered within 90 days, symptoms peaked during the second week. In patients who did not recover before 90 days, symptoms peaked at two months.23

The most common symptoms after six months are fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction.23

A survey showed that 85.9% of patients with symptoms of long COVID lasting for more than six months experienced relapses, triggered mainly by physical activity, stress, exercise, or mental activity.23

Postexertional malaise, a hallmark of long COVID, is a disabling, often delayed exhaustion disproportionate to the effort exerted. It is characterized by improvement followed by severe exhaustion and worsening of symptoms requiring several days or weeks of recovery.1,20,28 Similar to other relapsing symptoms, postexertional malaise can be triggered by routine physical activities (e.g., bathing), cognitive activities, and emotional stress.1,20,23,28 The onset of symptoms is often delayed (12 to 72 hours after activity) with unpredictable severity.1,28 Postexertional malaise is distinct from fatigue, which is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy.20
