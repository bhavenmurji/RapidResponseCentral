abstract: Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis
  (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year,
  there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease and up to 13 million people
  were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable
  infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress
  to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals
  with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
  recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma
  release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in health
  care professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting
  is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed
  and, in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum collected for diagnosis.
  Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local
  or state health departments. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid
  in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of
  three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes
  an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide,
  and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with
  two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert
  is necessary if there is suspicion or confirmation of drug-resistant TB.

# Tuberculosis: Common Questions and Answers.

## Abstract

Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year, there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease and up to 13 million people were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in health care professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed and, in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum collected for diagnosis. Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local or state health departments. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert is necessary if there is suspicion or confirmation of drug-resistant TB.

Primary care clinicians are uniquely situated to provide holistic contraceptive care. This article addresses emergency contraception, fertility awareness methods of contraception, long-acting reversible contraception, and contraception options for transgender people with a...

## Acute Headache in Adults: A Diagnostic Approach

A detailed history and physical examination can distinguish between key features of benign primary headaches and concerning symptoms that warrant further evaluation for a secondary headache. Among primary headache disorders, tension-type is the most common, although migraine...

## Malaria: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment

S. David Shahbodaghi, Nicholas A. Rathjen

Malaria causes an estimated 500,000 deaths annually worldwide, with an estimated 2,000 cases occurring each year in the United States. All febrile travelers who have recently returned from a malarious area should be evaluated for malaria.

## Thrombocytopenia: Evaluation and Management

Robert L. Gauer, Daniel J. Whitaker

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count less than 150 × 103 per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are...

## Chronic Constipation in Adults

Kerry Sadler, Frank Arnold, Spencer Dean

Evaluation of chronic constipation should distinguish primary from secondary constipation. First-line treatment for primary constipation includes fluid intake, dietary fiber, and osmotic laxatives. Second-line therapy includes a brief trial of stimulant laxatives followed by...

## Tuberculosis: Common Questions and Answers

Holly Hartman-Adams, Robert M. Gerbo, Saira George

Latent tuberculosis (TB) infection is asymptomatic and not contagious, but without treatment it can progress to active TB disease. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease and those at increased risk of latent TB infection should be screened. This article discusses screening...

## Contraception Recommendations: Updates for the Busy Clinician

Elizabeth A. Clark, Kathryn M. Curtis

Primary care clinicians are an important source of reproductive health care for their patients. Knowledge of contraception methods is essential to informed patient-centered decision-making about contraceptive options.

## Incorporating Lifestyle Medicine Into Practice: A Prescription for Better Health

The U.S. health care system’s focus on high-tech procedures and the latest pharmaceutical treatments is straining health budgets and worsening outcomes. The 10 leading causes of death in the United States can be directly impacted by lifestyle interventions.

## Oral Antihistamine/Analgesic/Decongestant Combinations for the Common Cold

Karl T. Clebak, Michael T. Partin, Nathan Borrero

Antihistamine/analgesic/decongestant combinations have some general benefit in adults and older children. However, these benefits must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. There is no evidence of effectiveness in young children.

## Lamotrigine in the Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar Disorder

Compared with placebo, lamotrigine reduces the recurrence of manic symptoms at one year and the need for additional psychotropics necessitated by worsening clinical symptoms. The adverse effect profile of lamotrigine is similar to that of placebo.

## Collaborative Care for Depression in Older Adults

Alan Glaseroff, Ann Lindsay, Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering health care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

## Recreational Cannabis and Emergency Department Visits

Rebecca Mullen, Hannah Aho, Kristen DeSanto

Legalization of recreational cannabis is associated with an increase in cannabis-related visits to the ED, especially in patients younger than 29 years.

## Ibrexafungerp (Brexafemme) for the Treatment of Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Kelsea Woolfolk, Jonathan Hughes

Compared with oral fluconazole, ibrexafungerp is a significantly more expensive treatment option for adolescent, adult, and postmenarchal patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis and has not been shown to be more effective to date.

## Aspirin Use to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of...
