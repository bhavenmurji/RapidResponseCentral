abstract: Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions,
  which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis,
  and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer.
  Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention
  to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage
  rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score
  can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those
  at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage
  presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography,
  and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection
  with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated
  with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic
  and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may
  be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic
  treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular
  cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography
  is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended
  for suspected cancerous masses.
