abstract: Nocturnal enuresis is defined as nighttime urinary incontinence occurring
  at least twice weekly in children five years and older. Approximately 14% of children
  have spontaneous resolution each year without treatment. Subtypes of nocturnal enuresis
  include nonmonosymptomatic enuresis and primary and secondary monosymptomatic nocturnal
  enuresis. Monosymptomatic enuresis is characterized by nighttime bedwetting without
  daytime urinary incontinence. Pathophysiology of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal
  enuresis may be due to sleep arousal disorder, overproduction of urine, small bladder
  storage capacity, or detrusor overactivity. Children with nonmonosymptomatic enuresis
  have daytime and nighttime symptoms resulting from a variety of underlying etiologies.
  An in-depth history is an integral component of the initial evaluation. For all
  types of enuresis, a comprehensive physical examination and urinalysis should be
  performed to help identify the cause. It is important to reiterate to the family
  that bedwetting is not the child's fault. Treatment should begin with behavioral
  modification, which then progresses to enuresis alarm therapy and oral desmopressin.
  Enuresis alarm therapy is more likely to produce long-term success; desmopressin
  yields earlier symptom improvement. Treatment of secondary monosymptomatic nocturnal
  enuresis and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis should primarily focus on the underlying
  etiology. Pediatric urology referral should be made for refractory cases in which
  underlying genitourinary anomalies or neurologic disorders are more likely. .

## Abstract

Nocturnal enuresis is defined as nighttime urinary incontinence occurring at least twice weekly in children five years and older. Approximately 14% of children have spontaneous resolution each year without treatment. Subtypes of nocturnal enuresis include nonmonosymptomatic enuresis and primary and secondary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Monosymptomatic enuresis is characterized by nighttime bedwetting without daytime urinary incontinence. Pathophysiology of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis may be due to sleep arousal disorder, overproduction of urine, small bladder storage capacity, or detrusor overactivity. Children with nonmonosymptomatic enuresis have daytime and nighttime symptoms resulting from a variety of underlying etiologies. An in-depth history is an integral component of the initial evaluation. For all types of enuresis, a comprehensive physical examination and urinalysis should be performed to help identify the cause. It is important to reiterate to the family that bedwetting is not the child's fault. Treatment should begin with behavioral modification, which then progresses to enuresis alarm therapy and oral desmopressin. Enuresis alarm therapy is more likely to produce long-term success; desmopressin yields earlier symptom improvement. Treatment of secondary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis should primarily focus on the underlying etiology. Pediatric urology referral should be made for refractory cases in which underlying genitourinary anomalies or neurologic disorders are more likely. .
