abstract: Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical
  analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing
  for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch
  technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile
  infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte
  esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity
  shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the
  presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease
  or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones
  suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed
  in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should
  be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio.
  In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites
  is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result
  may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily
  treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture
  is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.
