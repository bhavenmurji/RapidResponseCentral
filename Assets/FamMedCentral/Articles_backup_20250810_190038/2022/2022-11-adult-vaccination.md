  receive a hepatitis B vaccine. A 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
  is recommended for all patients who are 65 years and older. Patients who receive
  15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a dose of 23-valent pneumococcal
  polysaccharide vaccine one year later. Adults 19 to 64 years of age should receive
  a pneumococcal vaccination if they have medical risk factors. A single dose of measles,
  mumps, and rubella vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive immunity,
  and additional doses are recommended for patients with HIV and postdelivery for
  pregnant patients who are not immune to rubella. A tetanus and diphtheria toxoids
  booster is recommended every 10 years. For pregnant patients and those in close
  contact with young infants, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular
  pertussis vaccine should be administered. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended
  for all people through 26 years of age. Herpes zoster vaccine is indicated for all
  adults 50 years and older. .

## Abstract

Adult vaccination rates are low in the United States, despite clear benefits for reducing morbidity and mortality. Vaccine science is evolving rapidly, and family physicians must maintain familiarity with the most recent guidelines. The recommended adult immunization schedule is updated annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All eligible patients should receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the current guidelines. Adults without contraindications should also receive an annual influenza vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for adults with specific risk factors. All pregnant patients, adults younger than 60 years, and those 60 years and older who have risk factors should receive a hepatitis B vaccine. A 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all patients who are 65 years and older. Patients who receive 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later. Adults 19 to 64 years of age should receive a pneumococcal vaccination if they have medical risk factors. A single dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive immunity, and additional doses are recommended for patients with HIV and postdelivery for pregnant patients who are not immune to rubella. A tetanus and diphtheria toxoids booster is recommended every 10 years. For pregnant patients and those in close contact with young infants, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine should be administered. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended for all people through 26 years of age. Herpes zoster vaccine is indicated for all adults 50 years and older. .
