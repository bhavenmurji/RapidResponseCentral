abstract: Physical activity has many health-related benefits, including prevention
  and management of chronic disease, weight management, and improved mental health.
  Active girls and women of all ages and abilities are at risk of relative energy
  deficiency in sport, a syndrome encompassing low energy availability, menstrual
  irregularities, and disordered bone metabolism. Presence of amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea
  may suggest reduced energy availability. Active females are at risk of overuse injuries,
  including patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, and stress fractures;
  treatment usually includes activity modification, a period of rest, and physical
  therapy. Active females are also at risk of acute injuries, including concussion
  and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Pregnant patients without contraindications
  who were physically active before pregnancy can continue these activities, and those
  who were not previously active may gradually increase their activity level to a
  goal of 150 minutes per week. Moderate exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk
  of gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. Postpartum
  exercise focused on core and pelvic floor strengthening can improve pelvic floor
  dysfunction. Supervised exercise programs focused on strength and balance have been
  consistently shown to reduce the risk of falls and injurious falls in older women.

# Care of the Active Female.

## Abstract

Physical activity has many health-related benefits, including prevention and management of chronic disease, weight management, and improved mental health. Active girls and women of all ages and abilities are at risk of relative energy deficiency in sport, a syndrome encompassing low energy availability, menstrual irregularities, and disordered bone metabolism. Presence of amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may suggest reduced energy availability. Active females are at risk of overuse injuries, including patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, and stress fractures; treatment usually includes activity modification, a period of rest, and physical therapy. Active females are also at risk of acute injuries, including concussion and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Pregnant patients without contraindications who were physically active before pregnancy can continue these activities, and those who were not previously active may gradually increase their activity level to a goal of 150 minutes per week. Moderate exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. Postpartum exercise focused on core and pelvic floor strengthening can improve pelvic floor dysfunction. Supervised exercise programs focused on strength and balance have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of falls and injurious falls in older women.
