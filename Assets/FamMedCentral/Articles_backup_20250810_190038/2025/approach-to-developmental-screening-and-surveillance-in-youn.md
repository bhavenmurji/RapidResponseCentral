abstract: Early childhood development focuses on physical well-being, the development
  of motor skills and social interaction patterns, and the attainment of specific
  cognitive and communication skills. Developmental delay occurs when children are
  slow to achieve expected age-related norms for specific skills and may suggest underlying
  disease states. Developmental disabilities tend to be chronic conditions that affect
  social, physical, or cognitive development; these are reported in about 9% of children.
  Early intervention improves developmental outcomes with the potential for immediate
  and lasting effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental
  surveillance at every well-child visit, using a validated developmental screening
  tool during the 9-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month well-child visits. The US Preventive
  Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal developmental
  screening for autism spectrum disorder or speech and language disorders at these
  ages. Family physicians should use their best judgment when deciding whether to
  implement universal developmental screening. Numerous screening tools are available
  with comparable sensitivity and specificity profiles at varying costs. For any child
  with developmental concerns, referral for diagnostic evaluation is warranted with
  access supported by federal law. Children younger than 3 years should be referred
  to early intervention services. Children 3 years and older are typically referred
  to school-based programs, although they may not be available to children in private
  schools without access to these resources. Chromosomal microarray testing or exome
  sequencing is recommended for children who have developmental disabilities without
  an explainable cause. Continued surveillance and/or screening is warranted at future
  appointments.

## Foreign Bodies in the Ear, Nose, and Throat

Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat are common in young children. For ear and nasal foreign bodies, in-office removal should be considered if objects are directly visible and graspable, and if the patient can cooperate or be adequately immobilized. All airway foreign...

This article is the 14th installment of the annual series and summarizes the 20 most clinically relevant POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) of 2024 for primary care physicians.

## Fingertip Injuries

Jordan Hilgefort, Jonathan Becker, Justin Chu

Family physicians can provide timely care for common fingertip injuries, including subungual hematoma, nail bed laceration, distal interphalangeal joint dislocation, distal phalanx fracture, mallet finger, and jersey finger, to minimize long-term disability and restore...

## Menopausal Hormone Therapy: Limited Benefits, Significant Harms

Adriane Fugh-Berman, Barbara Mintzes

Some symptoms attributed to menopause, including aches and pains, tiredness, incontinence, and mood disorders, are equally common among older men and more fairly attributed to aging.

## Surgical vs Nonsurgical Treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Thomas M. Neubauer, Jason B. Alisangco

A color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits) was assigned for this intervention because of the lack of conclusive data regarding many of the comparisons and heterogeneity of disease severity and defined outcomes among the studies.

## Benzgalantamine (Zunveyl) for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Alzheimer Disease

Esther M. Johnston, Jody L. Lounsbery

Benzgalantamine should improve cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease over the short-term, similarly to galantamine. Given the frequent intolerance of galantamine, benzgalantamine can be considered if intolerance occurs.

## Vaccines for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella in Children and Adolescents

Vaccination reduces the number of cases of MMR and varicella among children and adolescents. Common adverse effects include rash and seizures, with no evidence of any increased risk of autism spectrum disorder or inflammatory bowel disease.

## Effectiveness of Topical Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Eczema

Joseph R. Yancey, Samantha Green

Low- to moderate-confidence evidence shows that select topical anti-inflammatory drugs are the most effective treatment for eczema. These potent and very potent drugs include corticosteroids (eg, clobetasol), calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus 0.1%), and Janus kinase...
