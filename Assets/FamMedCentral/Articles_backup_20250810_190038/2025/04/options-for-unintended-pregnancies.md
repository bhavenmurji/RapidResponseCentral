abstract: Unintended pregnancies, which include pregnancies that are unplanned, mistimed,
  or unwanted, account for 42% of all pregnancies. In addition to obtaining a thorough
  history and performing a physical examination, family physicians are integral in
  providing counseling and resources to patients with unintended pregnancies. In accordance
  with the American Academy of Family Physicians policy statement, counseling should
  remain nonjudgmental and unbiased. Options include continuing the pregnancy and
  parenting, continuing the pregnancy and pursuing adoption, or having a medication
  or procedural abortion. If a patient chooses to parent the infant, physicians should
  be equipped to offer local resources. Physicians are not authorized to broker adoptions.
  Medication and procedural abortions are safe and effective for patients who choose
  abortion.

Unintended pregnancies, which include pregnancies that are unplanned, mistimed, or unwanted, account for 42% of all pregnancies. In addition to obtaining a thorough history and performing a physical examination, family physicians are integral in providing counseling and resources to patients with unintended pregnancies. In accordance with the American Academy of Family Physicians policy statement, counseling should remain nonjudgmental and unbiased. Options include continuing the pregnancy and parenting, continuing the pregnancy and pursuing adoption, or having a medication or procedural abortion. If a patient chooses to parent the infant, physicians should be equipped to offer local resources. Physicians are not authorized to broker adoptions. Medication and procedural abortions are safe and effective for patients who choose abortion.
