abstract: Childhood and adolescent immunizations compose a valuable public health
  tool to prevent infection, morbidity, and mortality. The American Academy of Family
  Physicians recommends that patients receive all recommended immunizations from their
  usual source of primary care and does not support nonmedical immunization exemptions.
  Maintaining high vaccination coverage is crucial for preventing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable
  diseases. Less than 70% of US children have received the full series of recommended
  vaccinations at 24 months of age. Using electronic health record reminders and creating
  standing orders to vaccinate according to protocol at every visit can address practice
  barriers to vaccination. Whereas most routine childhood immunizations have remained
  the same for the past 10 years, several considerable changes have occurred. With
  few exceptions, COVID-19 immunizations are recommended annually for all children
  to prevent disease and hospitalization and to decrease the risk of post-COVID-19
  condition. New pneumococcal vaccine formulations that protect against more serotypes
  are recommended. Pneumococcal vaccination decreases the risk of meningitis, pneumonia,
  and possibly acute otitis media in children. Either respiratory syncytial virus
  immunization for the mother between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation from September
  to January or the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab for the infant from October to
  March are now recommended for all mother-infant dyads to prevent severe illness.

## Health Maintenance in Postmenopausal Women

Monica Plesa, Anita Wong, Ereni Katsaggelos

In the United States, the average age of menopause is 52 years. Women will spend approximately one-third of their lives postmenopausal; therefore, physicians should be familiar with primary preventive care recommendations in this patient population.

## Update on Routine Immunizations for Children and Adolescents

Although most routine childhood immunizations have remained the same for the past 10 years, recommendations for COVID-19, pneumococcal, and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines have been updated.

## Trigeminal Neuralgia: Rapid Evidence Review

## Methotrexate for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

Given the suboptimal dosing of methotrexate and low certainty of evidence, we assigned a color recommendation of yellow (unclear benefits). Further research with optimal dosing of methotrexate and longer follow-up is needed to properly assess the use of methotrexate in JIA...
