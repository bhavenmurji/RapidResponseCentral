abstract: Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat are common in young children
  and can also occur in other populations. Patients with foreign bodies in the ear
  (ie, external auditory canal) are usually asymptomatic but can present with otalgia,
  sensation of fullness, hypoacusis, pruritus, and otorrhea (usually bleeding). Removal
  in the office may be attempted in cooperative or appropriately restrained patients
  with irrigation or instrumentation, depending on the type of object and degree of
  impaction. Similarly, nasal foreign bodies can often be removed safely in the office
  with positive pressure techniques followed by instrumentation when the object is
  visible. A wide range of tools and methods have been described, yet evidence is
  lacking to recommend specific instruments or techniques. Referral is indicated for
  patients with external auditory canal or nasal foreign bodies that are more difficult
  or dangerous to remove, such as when the patient cannot be safely immobilized, the
  object is penetrating or a button battery, or removal attempts have failed. Foreign
  bodies of the throat pose significant and immediate risks to the airway and require
  urgent emergency management. All patients with airway foreign bodies should be referred
  to the emergency department for sedation, direct visualization of the object via
  flexible or rigid endoscope, and removal.

## Abstract

Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat are common in young children and can also occur in other populations. Patients with foreign bodies in the ear (ie, external auditory canal) are usually asymptomatic but can present with otalgia, sensation of fullness, hypoacusis, pruritus, and otorrhea (usually bleeding). Removal in the office may be attempted in cooperative or appropriately restrained patients with irrigation or instrumentation, depending on the type of object and degree of impaction. Similarly, nasal foreign bodies can often be removed safely in the office with positive pressure techniques followed by instrumentation when the object is visible. A wide range of tools and methods have been described, yet evidence is lacking to recommend specific instruments or techniques. Referral is indicated for patients with external auditory canal or nasal foreign bodies that are more difficult or dangerous to remove, such as when the patient cannot be safely immobilized, the object is penetrating or a button battery, or removal attempts have failed. Foreign bodies of the throat pose significant and immediate risks to the airway and require urgent emergency management. All patients with airway foreign bodies should be referred to the emergency department for sedation, direct visualization of the object via flexible or rigid endoscope, and removal.
