abstract: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant and preventable public
  health problem defined as behavior by a romantic or sex partner that causes physical,
  sexual, or psychological harm. Although individuals of all gender identities experience
  IPV, women, especially those of reproductive age, are more likely to experience
  severe IPV. Patients who are from a rural area or are members of a historically
  marginalized population, such as immigrants, refugees, or the lesbian, gay, bisexual,
  transgender, queer, plus community, also have increased risk of IPV. Multiple negative
  physical and mental health outcomes are associated with IPV. Guidelines from the
  US Preventive Services Task Force and other organizations recommend screening women
  of reproductive age for IPV and recommend against universal screening. Universal
  education bypasses the need for disclosure of IPV and promotes normalizing conversations
  about IPV using nonjudgmental language while maintaining privacy and prioritizing
  resource provision. Universal education focuses on a patient-centered, trauma-informed
  approach that provides brief education, support, and referrals to services as desired;
  individuals can disclose IPV on their own terms.

## Abstract

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant and preventable public health problem defined as behavior by a romantic or sex partner that causes physical, sexual, or psychological harm. Although individuals of all gender identities experience IPV, women, especially those of reproductive age, are more likely to experience severe IPV. Patients who are from a rural area or are members of a historically marginalized population, such as immigrants, refugees, or the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus community, also have increased risk of IPV. Multiple negative physical and mental health outcomes are associated with IPV. Guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other organizations recommend screening women of reproductive age for IPV and recommend against universal screening. Universal education bypasses the need for disclosure of IPV and promotes normalizing conversations about IPV using nonjudgmental language while maintaining privacy and prioritizing resource provision. Universal education focuses on a patient-centered, trauma-informed approach that provides brief education, support, and referrals to services as desired; individuals can disclose IPV on their own terms.
