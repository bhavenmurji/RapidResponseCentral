abstract: This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2024 identified as
  POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters). Based on a network meta-analysis,
  the oral antibiotics most likely to be effective for community-acquired pneumonia
  are telithromycin (not available in the United States), azithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate,
  and the quinolones levofloxacin and nemonoxacin (not available in the United States).
  The oral antivirals molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduce hospitalizations
  in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. In average-risk infants, a single dose
  of nirsevimab reduces hospitalizations due to respiratory syncytial virus. Amoxicillin
  with or without clavulanate is more effective than placebo for children with symptoms
  of acute sinusitis. Benzyl benzoate 25% is highly effective for scabies in adolescents
  and adults. Lactobacillus-containing probiotics reduce the incidence of recurrent
  urinary tract infections (UTIs) in premenopausal women with frequent UTIs. Low-dose
  amitriptyline is effective as second-line therapy for irritable bowel syndrome.
  For patients with uncomplicated gallstones, conservative management is a reasonable
  option. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1
  (GLP-1) receptor agonists are better than older drugs at improving patient-oriented
  outcomes for type 2 diabetes. Continuous or intermittent glucose monitoring is minimally
  effective for control of type 2 diabetes and can be harmful. Phentermine-topiramate
  and GLP-1 receptor agonists are the most effective drugs for promoting weight loss.
  Semaglutide is effective for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people
  with obesity and no diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists decrease
  cardiovascular death in older adults with type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Beta
  blockers do not prevent subsequent events after myocardial infarction in patients
  with preserved ejection fraction. For patients who do not quit smoking after a trial
  of varenicline or combined nicotine replacement therapy, a higher dose of either
  drug can increase quit rates. e-Cigarettes increase abstinence from smoking, but
  long-term vaping is a consequence for some. Oral naltrexone and acamprosate are
  safe and effective treatments for alcohol use disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy
  can reduce fatigue attributed to long COVID. New monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer
  disease are harmful, expensive, and minimally effective. Clinicians may choose to
  deliver bad news in person or by telephone, using their judgment or patient preference
  to decide which is best for the patient.

## Abstract

This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2024 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters). Based on a network meta-analysis, the oral antibiotics most likely to be effective for community-acquired pneumonia are telithromycin (not available in the United States), azithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the quinolones levofloxacin and nemonoxacin (not available in the United States). The oral antivirals molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduce hospitalizations in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. In average-risk infants, a single dose of nirsevimab reduces hospitalizations due to respiratory syncytial virus. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is more effective than placebo for children with symptoms of acute sinusitis. Benzyl benzoate 25% is highly effective for scabies in adolescents and adults. Lactobacillus-containing probiotics reduce the incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in premenopausal women with frequent UTIs. Low-dose amitriptyline is effective as second-line therapy for irritable bowel syndrome. For patients with uncomplicated gallstones, conservative management is a reasonable option. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are better than older drugs at improving patient-oriented outcomes for type 2 diabetes. Continuous or intermittent glucose monitoring is minimally effective for control of type 2 diabetes and can be harmful. Phentermine-topiramate and GLP-1 receptor agonists are the most effective drugs for promoting weight loss. Semaglutide is effective for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with obesity and no diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists decrease cardiovascular death in older adults with type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Beta blockers do not prevent subsequent events after myocardial infarction in patients with preserved ejection fraction. For patients who do not quit smoking after a trial of varenicline or combined nicotine replacement therapy, a higher dose of either drug can increase quit rates. e-Cigarettes increase abstinence from smoking, but long-term vaping is a consequence for some. Oral naltrexone and acamprosate are safe and effective treatments for alcohol use disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy can reduce fatigue attributed to long COVID. New monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer disease are harmful, expensive, and minimally effective. Clinicians may choose to deliver bad news in person or by telephone, using their judgment or patient preference to decide which is best for the patient.
