abstract: Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused
  by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection,
  bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most
  often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections,
  lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting
  with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed
  for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected
  complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood
  of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should
  be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative
  initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision
  rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis.
  Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory
  testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms
  after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and
  noninfectious causes.

## Abstract

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.
