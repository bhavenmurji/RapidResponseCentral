  must recognize when these indicate an underlying disorder and offer constructive
  and evidence-based strategies to support healthy child development and family well-being.
  Behavioral interventions and education to address sleep issues can alleviate stress
  and decrease fatigue for the whole family. Thumb-sucking and pacifier use have dental
  and social consequences if they persist beyond 3 years of age. Eating problems in
  childhood are common; in most cases, reassurance and trying new foods can improve
  picky eating. Readiness to begin school depends on child, family, and societal factors,
  and needs an individualized approach that emphasizes inclusion while ensuring person-centered
  success. Reading and participation in early childhood educational programs improve
  literacy and classroom preparation. Oral health is an important part of childhood
  well-being; preventive care, including fluoridation, should begin when the first
  tooth has erupted.

## Abstract

Common early childhood concerns and behaviors include sleep issues, thumb-sucking, pacifier use, picky eating, school readiness, and oral health. Family physicians must recognize when these indicate an underlying disorder and offer constructive and evidence-based strategies to support healthy child development and family well-being. Behavioral interventions and education to address sleep issues can alleviate stress and decrease fatigue for the whole family. Thumb-sucking and pacifier use have dental and social consequences if they persist beyond 3 years of age. Eating problems in childhood are common; in most cases, reassurance and trying new foods can improve picky eating. Readiness to begin school depends on child, family, and societal factors, and needs an individualized approach that emphasizes inclusion while ensuring person-centered success. Reading and participation in early childhood educational programs improve literacy and classroom preparation. Oral health is an important part of childhood well-being; preventive care, including fluoridation, should begin when the first tooth has erupted.
