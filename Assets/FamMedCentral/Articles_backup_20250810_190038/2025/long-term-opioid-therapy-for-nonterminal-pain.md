abstract: Chronic pain, defined as persistent pain lasting longer than 12 weeks, affects
  approximately 20% of US adults and often results in mental and social burdens. In
  general, nonopioid therapies are preferred for chronic nonterminal pain, and opioid
  therapy should not be considered a first-line treatment modality. Health disparities
  in pain management affect vulnerable populations, including racially and ethnically
  marginalized groups and those with cognitive impairment. Clinicians first must acknowledge
  the existing health inequities and the stigma surrounding chronic pain and then
  need to provide culturally tailored pain management. Opioid use should be limited
  to circumstances wherein benefits outweigh risks, such as in cases of nonterminal
  pain refractory to multiple other interventions. Harms of opioid therapy include
  constipation, depression, hormonal dysregulation, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and
  overdose. Given the high prevalence of behavioral health disorders in individuals
  with chronic pain, it is crucial to address mental health in conjunction with pain
  management. Before prescribing opioids, it is essential to review risk factors for
  opioid use disorder and respiratory depression and to set realistic goals for improving
  function. Ongoing monitoring should include assessments of functional progress,
  urine drug testing, and review of data from the state prescription drug monitoring
  program. Buprenorphine is an effective medication for chronic pain management and
  may be safer than full opioid agonists, especially in individuals at risk for opioid
  use disorder, opioid misuse, or overdose.

## Article Content

## Acute Monoarthritis: Diagnosis in Adults

Jeremy Swisher, Zachary Sitton, Kimberly Burbank, Chris Nelson

The most common causes of acute monoarthritis include osteoarthritis, gout, pseudogout, and trauma. Septic arthritis is a less common cause, but it necessitates urgent intervention.

## Long-Term Opioid Therapy for Nonterminal Pain

Health disparities in pain management tend to affect vulnerable populations. Clinicians must acknowledge the inequities and stigma surrounding chronic pain and need to provide culturally tailored pain management. First-line therapies include nonopioid drugs; long-term opioid...

## Nocturia: Evaluation and Management

Feven W. Getaneh, Rachael D. Sussman, Cheryl B. Iglesia

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void during the night) is clinically significant if it occurs two or more times per night. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies. The addition of pharmacotherapy may be considered. Patients with...

## Endometrial Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

Carl Bryce, Renee Gazda, Hadass Fuerst

North America has the highest global incidence of endometrial cancer, and the incidence and mortality rates are increasing. Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, is the most common symptom.

## Evaluation of Short and Tall Stature in Children

Rebecca Caro, Paul Savel, Paul Isaiah Moss

The first step in the evaluation of short and tall stature in children is to record and plot growth measurements on a growth curve. Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that...

## Historical Perspectives on Race-Based Medicine in American Family Physician

Kenneth W. Lin, Priscilla Auguste, Christopher W. Bunt, Michelle Nelson

With notable exceptions, past authors and editors of American Family Physician mostly treated race and ethnicity as sociopolitical constructs rather than inherent biologic traits.

## Family Physicians Should Generate Our Own Data and Guidelines to Help Patients With Sinusitis

Global overuse of antibiotics increases antibiotic resistance and unnecessary medication-related adverse events; reducing inappropriate prescribing for acute rhinosinusitis is crucial to limiting the development and spread of antibiotic resistance.

## Fidaxomicin vs Vancomycin for Clostridioides difficile Infection

Given the existing evidence, we have assigned a color recommendation of green (benefits greater than harms) for fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin for the treatment of C difficile infections.

## Blood Pressure Targets for Hypertension in People With Chronic Kidney Disease

Tara Devaraj, Karl T. Clebak, Zakary S. Newberry

Having a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher blood pressure target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events,...

## Educational Interventions Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Elizabeth Chiang, Rashmi Rode, Arindam Sarkar

When combined with adverse drug reaction reporting forms and reminder cards, educational interventions improve the overall reporting rate by health care professionals compared with standard spontaneous reporting. Improving hospital-based health care professionals’ access to...

## Buprenorphine-Naloxone for Pregnant Patients With Opioid Use Disorder

Ellen Tran, Sarah Peterson, Dara Jolly, Jon O. Neher

Buprenorphine-naloxone can be used to treat opioid use disorder in pregnant patients. It has an obstetric safety profile similar to those of alternative treatments for this disorder and is associated with a lower rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.

A 27-year-old man presented with a rash that was not painful or pruritic.

## Hypertrophic Nodules on the Knuckles

A 44-year-old woman presented with pruritic hand lesions that had been present for several years.

## Lecanemab (Leqembi) for the Slowing of Alzheimer Disease

Lecanemab is an expensive treatment option with noteworthy potential risks and should be prescribed for select patients (ie, with early disease and confirmed amyloid plaque deposition) who understand the ratio of benefit to risk and who can afford it.
