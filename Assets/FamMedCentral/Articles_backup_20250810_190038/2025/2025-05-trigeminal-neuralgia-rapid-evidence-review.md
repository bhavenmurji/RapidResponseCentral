abstract: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic pain condition that causes
  sudden, brief episodes of electric shock-like, lancinating pain in one or more trigeminal
  nerve distributions. Facial spasms may occur during intense flare-ups. Trigger zones
  are small areas where minimal stimulation may precipitate a painful flare-up. Painful
  episodes of TN are often precipitated by seemingly benign stimuli, such as talking,
  chewing, light touch, or even a breeze across a trigger zone. Nerve root contact,
  compression, and subsequent demyelination are implicated as the central underlying
  pathophysiology. The average age of onset is 50 to 60 years, and incidence increases
  with age. Diagnosis is based on International Headache Society clinical criteria
  distinguishing classic, secondary, and idiopathic TN. Classic TN is caused by direct
  neurovascular compromise due to anatomic compression. Secondary TN is caused by
  another condition such as multiple sclerosis or a tumor. Idiopathic TN has no identifiable
  etiology. Examination findings typically are normal between painful episodes. Brain
  magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media is recommended for all
  patients with suspected TN to rule out key differential diagnoses, such as a tumor,
  and to determine surgical candidacy. The International Headache Society guidelines
  encourage tailored treatment based on TN type and etiology. Carbamazepine is the
  initial drug of choice, and 75% of patients with TN achieve initial symptom control
  with pharmacotherapy. Refractory TN or intolerable adverse drug effects should prompt
  a trial of adjunctive drugs and referral for surgical evaluation. Microvascular
  decompression is more effective in improving or alleviating symptoms of TN than
  other surgical options.

## Abstract

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic pain condition that causes sudden, brief episodes of electric shock-like, lancinating pain in one or more trigeminal nerve distributions. Facial spasms may occur during intense flare-ups. Trigger zones are small areas where minimal stimulation may precipitate a painful flare-up. Painful episodes of TN are often precipitated by seemingly benign stimuli, such as talking, chewing, light touch, or even a breeze across a trigger zone. Nerve root contact, compression, and subsequent demyelination are implicated as the central underlying pathophysiology. The average age of onset is 50 to 60 years, and incidence increases with age. Diagnosis is based on International Headache Society clinical criteria distinguishing classic, secondary, and idiopathic TN. Classic TN is caused by direct neurovascular compromise due to anatomic compression. Secondary TN is caused by another condition such as multiple sclerosis or a tumor. Idiopathic TN has no identifiable etiology. Examination findings typically are normal between painful episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media is recommended for all patients with suspected TN to rule out key differential diagnoses, such as a tumor, and to determine surgical candidacy. The International Headache Society guidelines encourage tailored treatment based on TN type and etiology. Carbamazepine is the initial drug of choice, and 75% of patients with TN achieve initial symptom control with pharmacotherapy. Refractory TN or intolerable adverse drug effects should prompt a trial of adjunctive drugs and referral for surgical evaluation. Microvascular decompression is more effective in improving or alleviating symptoms of TN than other surgical options.
