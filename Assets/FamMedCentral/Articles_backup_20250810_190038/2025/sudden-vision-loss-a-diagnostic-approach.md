abstract: Vision loss affects more than 7 million Americans and impacts quality of
  life, independence, social functioning, and overall health. Common and dangerous
  conditions causing sudden vision loss include acute angle-closure glaucoma, retinal
  detachment, retinal artery occlusion, giant cell arteritis, and optic neuritis.
  Acute angle-closure glaucoma features ocular pain, headache, and nausea; treatment
  includes pilocarpine eye drops, oral or intravenous acetazolamide, and intravenous
  mannitol. Retinal detachment presents with a curtain-like visual field defect and
  usually requires surgical intervention. Retinal artery occlusion causes painless
  vision loss in patients with vascular risk factors, and interventions aim to prevent
  vision loss in the other eye. Giant cell arteritis should be suspected in patients
  older than 50 years with scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, proximal muscle and
  joint pain, constitutional symptoms, and elevated C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte
  sedimentation rate, and platelet count. This condition requires immediate initiation
  of empiric steroids to prevent vision loss in the unaffected eye, as well as referral
  for a temporal artery biopsy. Optic neuritis is a demyelinating condition that features
  color desaturation, relative afferent pupillary defect, and pain with extraocular
  muscle movements. Treatment requires high-dose steroids, and patients should be
  evaluated for multiple sclerosis.
