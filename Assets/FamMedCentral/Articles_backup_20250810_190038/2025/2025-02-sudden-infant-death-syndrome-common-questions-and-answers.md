abstract: Sudden unexpected infant death is an umbrella term that describes death
  that occurs in infants younger than 12 months that does not have an immediately
  obvious cause. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is diagnosed when there is no
  other explanation for the death after a detailed investigation. Despite a decrease
  in the incidence of SIDS after instituting the Back to Sleep campaign in 1992, sudden
  unexpected infant death remains a leading cause of infant death, and rates have
  plateaued. Although there has been a decrease in the incidence of SIDS, these numbers
  likely reflect improved investigations because rates of sudden unexpected infant
  death have remained stable. Recommended risk reduction strategies include promotion
  of a supine sleep position, safe sleep surfaces, room sharing, breast milk feeding,
  and pacifier use. Families should be counseled to avoid sharing sleep surfaces,
  overheating, loose bedding and inclined surfaces, and parental use of tobacco or
  alcohol. Infant swaddling without hats is recommended until they are attempting
  to roll over, after which appropriate clothing or wearable blankets can be worn.
  Family physicians should prioritize early education and consistent messaging to
  promote SIDS risk reduction.

## Abstract

Sudden unexpected infant death is an umbrella term that describes death that occurs in infants younger than 12 months that does not have an immediately obvious cause. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is diagnosed when there is no other explanation for the death after a detailed investigation. Despite a decrease in the incidence of SIDS after instituting the Back to Sleep campaign in 1992, sudden unexpected infant death remains a leading cause of infant death, and rates have plateaued. Although there has been a decrease in the incidence of SIDS, these numbers likely reflect improved investigations because rates of sudden unexpected infant death have remained stable. Recommended risk reduction strategies include promotion of a supine sleep position, safe sleep surfaces, room sharing, breast milk feeding, and pacifier use. Families should be counseled to avoid sharing sleep surfaces, overheating, loose bedding and inclined surfaces, and parental use of tobacco or alcohol. Infant swaddling without hats is recommended until they are attempting to roll over, after which appropriate clothing or wearable blankets can be worn. Family physicians should prioritize early education and consistent messaging to promote SIDS risk reduction.
