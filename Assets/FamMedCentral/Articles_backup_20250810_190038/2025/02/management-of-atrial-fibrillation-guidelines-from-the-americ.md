## Lower Extremity Abnormalities in Children

Drew C. Baird, Caleb G. Dickison, Hayley I. Spires

This article discusses three common types of nontraumatic lower extremity conditions: intoeing, out-toeing, and angular variations and how to distinguish normal variations from pathologic deformities that require referral.

## Gastric Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

Patients with gastric cancer are often asymptomatic or have general symptoms such as weight loss and abdominal pain, which often precludes an early diagnosis. When the condition is suspected, the recommended initial test is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with multiple...

## Acid-Base Interpretation: A Practical Approach

Masahiro J. Morikawa, Prakash R. Ganesh

A systematic approach to evaluating acid-base disorders provides vital diagnostic information and guides timely treatment. The first step is identifying the primary process that is causing acid-base disturbance.

## Genital Warts: Rapid Evidence Review

Richard W. Temple, Jackeline C. L. Larker, Janelle M. Brus

Most cases of genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. In the United States, HPV vaccination was first recommended for females in 2006 and males in 2011. Since that time, vaccination has resulted in significant decreases in the prevalence of...

## Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Common Questions and Answers

Hillary J. Darrow, Kayla A. Carman, Vernon Wheeler

Although talking about infant death can be difficult for families and physicians, early introduction and consistent messaging allows parents to reduce the risk of SIDS. This article reviews common questions about SIDS and presents evidence-based answers.

## Evidence Considerations for Recent USPSTF Recommendations

Some recent recommendations have raised concerns about the consistency of the USPSTF’s processes and how they are applied.

## Advancing Risk Prediction for Cardiovascular Disease: the AHA PREVENT Equations

The PREVENT equations estimate the risk for total CVD and have several advantages, including broader generalizability, longer-term risk estimates, and more comprehensive inclusion of factors related to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome.

## SGLT-2 for Diabetes, Biliary Pain, Depression in Adolescents, Intermittent Catheterization, Labor Induction, Umbilical Hernias, Multivitamins

Key clinical questions and their evidence-based answers directly from the journal’s content, written by and for family physicians.

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

Sarah M. Abuali, D. Jason Frasca

A color recommendation of red was chosen for use of alpha-lipoic acid in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treatment, based on moderate-certainty evidence showing little to no benefit of alpha-lipoic acid use on neurologic symptoms, impairment, or risk of adverse events...

## Interventions for Fatigue in Patients With Kidney Failure Who Are Receiving Dialysis

Fatigue in people who have kidney failure and are receiving dialysis may be improved with exercise, aromatherapy, massage, and acupressure compared with patients receiving placebo, control, standard of care, or no intervention. Other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic...

## Topical Corticosteroids for Treating Phimosis in Boys

Juan Qiu, Dongsheng Jiang, Kristen Grine

Compared with placebo or no treatment, topical corticosteroids may increase the frequency of complete resolution and partial resolution of phimosis in boys after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids also may increase the probability of...

## Ceramide Testing for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Ashley Koontz Sturts, Nathan Borrero, Kilash Anthraper

Ceramide testing is not recommended for clinical use due to its high cost, limited availability, and lack of sufficient validation. Primary care physicians should instead rely on traditional cholesterol screening and validated cardiovascular risk calculators, which remain the...

## Ultrasound- vs Landmark-Guided Steroid Injection for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Hendrik Stegall, Scott Hall, Laura Elizabeth Moreno

Ultrasonography-guided steroid injection should be considered for carpal tunnel syndrome because statistically significant benefits have been shown in symptom and functional improvement and a reduced rate of complications compared with landmark-guided injection.

An 18-month-old girl presented with a skin eruption.

## Management of Atrial Fibrillation: Guidelines From the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released guidelines for managing patients with atrial fibrillation.

## Plantar Fasciitis: Guidelines From the American Physical Therapy Association

Michael J. Arnold, Christopher Beaumont, Lindsay Savage
