abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest and most diagnosed cancers, although
  the annual incidence has been steadily decreasing. Gastric cancer risk is multifactorial
  with a clear association with Helicobacter pylori infection. In the United States,
  the age-adjusted annual incidence is 4.1 per 100,000 people with a mortality rate
  of 1.6; the global adjusted annual incidence is roughly twice as much with a mortality
  rate four times higher. No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the benefit
  of endoscopy or serum pepsinogen measurement in screening for gastric cancer. Patients
  are often asymptomatic or have general symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain,
  nausea, and anorexia, which can preclude an early diagnosis. When gastric cancer
  is suspected, the recommended initial test is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with
  multiple tissue biopsies. A multidisciplinary treatment team should be assembled,
  and shared decision-making should occur with consideration of cancer staging, comorbidities,
  and available treatments. Treatment is guided by extent of disease, histopathology,
  and tumor biomarkers. Chemotherapy and radiation, in addition to various targeted
  therapies, may be treatment options for tumors regardless of resectability. Prognosis
  is directly related to the extent of disease at diagnosis; the 5-year survival rate
  of treated localized disease is more than 70% vs less than 10% for distant metastatic
  disease.

## Abstract

Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest and most diagnosed cancers, although the annual incidence has been steadily decreasing. Gastric cancer risk is multifactorial with a clear association with Helicobacter pylori infection. In the United States, the age-adjusted annual incidence is 4.1 per 100,000 people with a mortality rate of 1.6; the global adjusted annual incidence is roughly twice as much with a mortality rate four times higher. No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the benefit of endoscopy or serum pepsinogen measurement in screening for gastric cancer. Patients are often asymptomatic or have general symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, and anorexia, which can preclude an early diagnosis. When gastric cancer is suspected, the recommended initial test is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with multiple tissue biopsies. A multidisciplinary treatment team should be assembled, and shared decision-making should occur with consideration of cancer staging, comorbidities, and available treatments. Treatment is guided by extent of disease, histopathology, and tumor biomarkers. Chemotherapy and radiation, in addition to various targeted therapies, may be treatment options for tumors regardless of resectability. Prognosis is directly related to the extent of disease at diagnosis; the 5-year survival rate of treated localized disease is more than 70% vs less than 10% for distant metastatic disease.

## Lower Extremity Abnormalities in Children

Drew C. Baird, Caleb G. Dickison, Hayley I. Spires

This article discusses three common types of nontraumatic lower extremity conditions: intoeing, out-toeing, and angular variations and how to distinguish normal variations from pathologic deformities that require referral.

## Gastric Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

Patients with gastric cancer are often asymptomatic or have general symptoms such as weight loss and abdominal pain, which often precludes an early diagnosis. When the condition is suspected, the recommended initial test is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with multiple...

## Acid-Base Interpretation: A Practical Approach

Masahiro J. Morikawa, Prakash R. Ganesh

A systematic approach to evaluating acid-base disorders provides vital diagnostic information and guides timely treatment. The first step is identifying the primary process that is causing acid-base disturbance.

## Genital Warts: Rapid Evidence Review

Richard W. Temple, Jackeline C. L. Larker, Janelle M. Brus

Most cases of genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. In the United States, HPV vaccination was first recommended for females in 2006 and males in 2011. Since that time, vaccination has resulted in significant decreases in the prevalence of...

## Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Common Questions and Answers

Hillary J. Darrow, Kayla A. Carman, Vernon Wheeler

Although talking about infant death can be difficult for families and physicians, early introduction and consistent messaging allows parents to reduce the risk of SIDS. This article reviews common questions about SIDS and presents evidence-based answers.

## Evidence Considerations for Recent USPSTF Recommendations

Some recent recommendations have raised concerns about the consistency of the USPSTF‚Äôs processes and how they are applied.

## Advancing Risk Prediction for Cardiovascular Disease: the AHA PREVENT Equations

The PREVENT equations estimate the risk for total CVD and have several advantages, including broader generalizability, longer-term risk estimates, and more comprehensive inclusion of factors related to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome.

## Alpha-Lipoic Acid for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

Sarah M. Abuali, D. Jason Frasca

A color recommendation of red was chosen for use of alpha-lipoic acid in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treatment, based on moderate-certainty evidence showing little to no benefit of alpha-lipoic acid use on neurologic symptoms, impairment, or risk of adverse events...

## Interventions for Fatigue in Patients With Kidney Failure Who Are Receiving Dialysis

Fatigue in people who have kidney failure and are receiving dialysis may be improved with exercise, aromatherapy, massage, and acupressure compared with patients receiving placebo, control, standard of care, or no intervention. Other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic...

## Topical Corticosteroids for Treating Phimosis in Boys

Juan Qiu, Dongsheng Jiang, Kristen Grine

Compared with placebo or no treatment, topical corticosteroids may increase the frequency of complete resolution and partial resolution of phimosis in boys after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids also may increase the probability of...

## Ceramide Testing for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Ashley Koontz Sturts, Nathan Borrero, Kilash Anthraper

Ceramide testing is not recommended for clinical use due to its high cost, limited availability, and lack of sufficient validation. Primary care physicians should instead rely on traditional cholesterol screening and validated cardiovascular risk calculators, which remain the...

## Ultrasound- vs Landmark-Guided Steroid Injection for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Hendrik Stegall, Scott Hall, Laura Elizabeth Moreno

Ultrasonography-guided steroid injection should be considered for carpal tunnel syndrome because statistically significant benefits have been shown in symptom and functional improvement and a reduced rate of complications compared with landmark-guided injection.
