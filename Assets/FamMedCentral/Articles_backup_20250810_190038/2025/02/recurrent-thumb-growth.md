## Lower Extremity Abnormalities in Children

Drew C. Baird, Caleb G. Dickison, Hayley I. Spires

This article discusses three common types of nontraumatic lower extremity conditions: intoeing, out-toeing, and angular variations and how to distinguish normal variations from pathologic deformities that require referral.

## Gastric Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

Patients with gastric cancer are often asymptomatic or have general symptoms such as weight loss and abdominal pain, which often precludes an early diagnosis. When the condition is suspected, the recommended initial test is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with multiple...

## Acid-Base Interpretation: A Practical Approach

Masahiro J. Morikawa, Prakash R. Ganesh

A systematic approach to evaluating acid-base disorders provides vital diagnostic information and guides timely treatment. The first step is identifying the primary process that is causing acid-base disturbance.

## Genital Warts: Rapid Evidence Review

Richard W. Temple, Jackeline C. L. Larker, Janelle M. Brus

Most cases of genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. In the United States, HPV vaccination was first recommended for females in 2006 and males in 2011. Since that time, vaccination has resulted in significant decreases in the prevalence of...

## Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Common Questions and Answers

Hillary J. Darrow, Kayla A. Carman, Vernon Wheeler

Although talking about infant death can be difficult for families and physicians, early introduction and consistent messaging allows parents to reduce the risk of SIDS. This article reviews common questions about SIDS and presents evidence-based answers.

## Evidence Considerations for Recent USPSTF Recommendations

Some recent recommendations have raised concerns about the consistency of the USPSTF’s processes and how they are applied.

## Advancing Risk Prediction for Cardiovascular Disease: the AHA PREVENT Equations

## Topical Corticosteroids for Treating Phimosis in Boys

Juan Qiu, Dongsheng Jiang, Kristen Grine

Compared with placebo or no treatment, topical corticosteroids may increase the frequency of complete resolution and partial resolution of phimosis in boys after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. Compared with placebo, topical corticosteroids also may increase the probability of...

## Ceramide Testing for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Ashley Koontz Sturts, Nathan Borrero, Kilash Anthraper

Ceramide testing is not recommended for clinical use due to its high cost, limited availability, and lack of sufficient validation. Primary care physicians should instead rely on traditional cholesterol screening and validated cardiovascular risk calculators, which remain the...

## Ultrasound- vs Landmark-Guided Steroid Injection for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Hendrik Stegall, Scott Hall, Laura Elizabeth Moreno
