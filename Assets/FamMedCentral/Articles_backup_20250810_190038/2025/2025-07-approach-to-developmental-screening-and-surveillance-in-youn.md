abstract: Early childhood development focuses on physical well-being, the development
  of motor skills and social interaction patterns, and the attainment of specific
  cognitive and communication skills. Developmental delay occurs when children are
  slow to achieve expected age-related norms for specific skills and may suggest underlying
  disease states. Developmental disabilities tend to be chronic conditions that affect
  social, physical, or cognitive development; these are reported in about 9% of children.
  Early intervention improves developmental outcomes with the potential for immediate
  and lasting effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental
  surveillance at every well-child visit, using a validated developmental screening
  tool during the 9-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month well-child visits. The US Preventive
  Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal developmental
  screening for autism spectrum disorder or speech and language disorders at these
  ages. Family physicians should use their best judgment when deciding whether to
  implement universal developmental screening. Numerous screening tools are available
  with comparable sensitivity and specificity profiles at varying costs. For any child
  with developmental concerns, referral for diagnostic evaluation is warranted with
  access supported by federal law. Children younger than 3 years should be referred
  to early intervention services. Children 3 years and older are typically referred
  to school-based programs, although they may not be available to children in private
  schools without access to these resources. Chromosomal microarray testing or exome
  sequencing is recommended for children who have developmental disabilities without
  an explainable cause. Continued surveillance and/or screening is warranted at future
  appointments.

## Abstract

Early childhood development focuses on physical well-being, the development of motor skills and social interaction patterns, and the attainment of specific cognitive and communication skills. Developmental delay occurs when children are slow to achieve expected age-related norms for specific skills and may suggest underlying disease states. Developmental disabilities tend to be chronic conditions that affect social, physical, or cognitive development; these are reported in about 9% of children. Early intervention improves developmental outcomes with the potential for immediate and lasting effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at every well-child visit, using a validated developmental screening tool during the 9-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month well-child visits. The US Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal developmental screening for autism spectrum disorder or speech and language disorders at these ages. Family physicians should use their best judgment when deciding whether to implement universal developmental screening. Numerous screening tools are available with comparable sensitivity and specificity profiles at varying costs. For any child with developmental concerns, referral for diagnostic evaluation is warranted with access supported by federal law. Children younger than 3 years should be referred to early intervention services. Children 3 years and older are typically referred to school-based programs, although they may not be available to children in private schools without access to these resources. Chromosomal microarray testing or exome sequencing is recommended for children who have developmental disabilities without an explainable cause. Continued surveillance and/or screening is warranted at future appointments.
