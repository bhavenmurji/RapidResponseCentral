## Abstract

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void one or more times per night) is common in adults, with increasing prevalence in older age. Nocturia is associated with increased risk of falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. In general, mechanisms for nocturia fall into one of four categories: increased nighttime urine production, decreased storage ability, incomplete bladder emptying, or primary sleep disorder. Although screening for nocturia currently is not recommended, patients reporting bothersome symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Initial workup includes assessing urinary symptoms, fluid intake, and comorbidities. Using validated nocturia questionnaires and frequency-volume charts (bladder diaries) can aid in diagnosis. A urinalysis should be performed for all patients. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies for nocturia. Limitation of fluid intake, especially in the evening; addressing timing of diuretic intake; and sleep hygiene are recommended. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved for those unresponsive to lifestyle modifications and adequate treatment of comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should target the etiology of nocturia, such as nocturnal polyuria, overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred for further treatment (eg, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, sacral neuromodulation, surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia).

Health disparities in pain management tend to affect vulnerable populations. Clinicians must acknowledge the inequities and stigma surrounding chronic pain and need to provide culturally tailored pain management. First-line therapies include nonopioid drugs; long-term opioid...

## Nocturia: Evaluation and Management

Feven W. Getaneh, Rachael D. Sussman, Cheryl B. Iglesia

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void during the night) is clinically significant if it occurs two or more times per night. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies. The addition of pharmacotherapy may be considered. Patients with...

Having a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher blood pressure target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events,...

## Educational Interventions Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Elizabeth Chiang, Rashmi Rode, Arindam Sarkar

When combined with adverse drug reaction reporting forms and reminder cards, educational interventions improve the overall reporting rate by health care professionals compared with standard spontaneous reporting. Improving hospital-based health care professionals’ access to...

## Buprenorphine-Naloxone for Pregnant Patients With Opioid Use Disorder

Ellen Tran, Sarah Peterson, Dara Jolly, Jon O. Neher

Buprenorphine-naloxone can be used to treat opioid use disorder in pregnant patients. It has an obstetric safety profile similar to those of alternative treatments for this disorder and is associated with a lower rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.
