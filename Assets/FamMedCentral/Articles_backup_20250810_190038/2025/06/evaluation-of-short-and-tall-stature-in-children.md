abstract: Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations
  below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that is more than
  2 standard deviations above the mean height for age. The initial evaluation of short
  and tall stature should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performing a
  physical examination, plotting serial height measurements on the Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention or World Health Organization growth charts, calculating estimated
  adult height and comparing it with midparental height, determining bone age, and
  laboratory testing in select patients. The most common causes of short stature are
  constitutional delay of growth and puberty, familial short stature, and idiopathic
  short stature. Pathologic etiologies are less common and include nutritional deficiencies,
  systemic disease, growth hormone deficiencies, and genetic abnormalities. Common
  causes of tall stature include constitutional advancement of growth, familial tall
  stature, and obesity. Uncommon etiologies of tall stature include precocious puberty,
  Marfan syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Referral to pediatric endocrinology is
  indicated in patients with idiopathic short stature for management of select genetic
  and metabolic conditions and for interventions to correct growth.

## Abstract

Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean height for age. The initial evaluation of short and tall stature should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performing a physical examination, plotting serial height measurements on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or World Health Organization growth charts, calculating estimated adult height and comparing it with midparental height, determining bone age, and laboratory testing in select patients. The most common causes of short stature are constitutional delay of growth and puberty, familial short stature, and idiopathic short stature. Pathologic etiologies are less common and include nutritional deficiencies, systemic disease, growth hormone deficiencies, and genetic abnormalities. Common causes of tall stature include constitutional advancement of growth, familial tall stature, and obesity. Uncommon etiologies of tall stature include precocious puberty, Marfan syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Referral to pediatric endocrinology is indicated in patients with idiopathic short stature for management of select genetic and metabolic conditions and for interventions to correct growth.

## Acute Monoarthritis: Diagnosis in Adults

Jeremy Swisher, Zachary Sitton, Kimberly Burbank, Chris Nelson

The most common causes of acute monoarthritis include osteoarthritis, gout, pseudogout, and trauma. Septic arthritis is a less common cause, but it necessitates urgent intervention.

## Long-Term Opioid Therapy for Nonterminal Pain

Health disparities in pain management tend to affect vulnerable populations. Clinicians must acknowledge the inequities and stigma surrounding chronic pain and need to provide culturally tailored pain management. First-line therapies include nonopioid drugs; long-term opioid...

## Nocturia: Evaluation and Management

Feven W. Getaneh, Rachael D. Sussman, Cheryl B. Iglesia

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void during the night) is clinically significant if it occurs two or more times per night. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies. The addition of pharmacotherapy may be considered. Patients with...

## Endometrial Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

Carl Bryce, Renee Gazda, Hadass Fuerst

North America has the highest global incidence of endometrial cancer, and the incidence and mortality rates are increasing. Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, is the most common symptom.

## Evaluation of Short and Tall Stature in Children

Rebecca Caro, Paul Savel, Paul Isaiah Moss

The first step in the evaluation of short and tall stature in children is to record and plot growth measurements on a growth curve. Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that...

## Historical Perspectives on Race-Based Medicine in American Family Physician

Kenneth W. Lin, Priscilla Auguste, Christopher W. Bunt, Michelle Nelson

With notable exceptions, past authors and editors of American Family Physician mostly treated race and ethnicity as sociopolitical constructs rather than inherent biologic traits.

## Family Physicians Should Generate Our Own Data and Guidelines to Help Patients With Sinusitis

Global overuse of antibiotics increases antibiotic resistance and unnecessary medication-related adverse events; reducing inappropriate prescribing for acute rhinosinusitis is crucial to limiting the development and spread of antibiotic resistance.

Given the existing evidence, we have assigned a color recommendation of green (benefits greater than harms) for fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin for the treatment of C difficile infections.

## Blood Pressure Targets for Hypertension in People With Chronic Kidney Disease

Tara Devaraj, Karl T. Clebak, Zakary S. Newberry

Having a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher blood pressure target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events,...

## Educational Interventions Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Elizabeth Chiang, Rashmi Rode, Arindam Sarkar

When combined with adverse drug reaction reporting forms and reminder cards, educational interventions improve the overall reporting rate by health care professionals compared with standard spontaneous reporting. Improving hospital-based health care professionals’ access to...

## Buprenorphine-Naloxone for Pregnant Patients With Opioid Use Disorder

Ellen Tran, Sarah Peterson, Dara Jolly, Jon O. Neher

Buprenorphine-naloxone can be used to treat opioid use disorder in pregnant patients. It has an obstetric safety profile similar to those of alternative treatments for this disorder and is associated with a lower rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.

## Bullous Rash on the Face and Neck

A 27-year-old man presented with a rash that was not painful or pruritic.

## Hypertrophic Nodules on the Knuckles

A 44-year-old woman presented with pruritic hand lesions that had been present for several years.

## Lecanemab (Leqembi) for the Slowing of Alzheimer Disease

Lecanemab is an expensive treatment option with noteworthy potential risks and should be prescribed for select patients (ie, with early disease and confirmed amyloid plaque deposition) who understand the ratio of benefit to risk and who can afford it.

## Inappropriate Use of Oral Antiplatelet Drugs

Alan Roth, Andy Lazris, Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering health care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

## Assessing the Risk of Developing Atrial Fibrillation

How can patients at high risk for developing atrial fibrillation be identified?

## Simple 2 Test for At-Home Gonorrhea and Chlamydia Testing

Tyler J. Raymond, Elizabeth McCarthy Depavloff

When compared with in-office testing, the Simple 2 Test accurately detects gonorrhea and chlamydia in adults 18 years and older who desire at-home testing. It addresses stigma concerns and barriers that patients may encounter when seeking in-clinic screening and improves STI...
