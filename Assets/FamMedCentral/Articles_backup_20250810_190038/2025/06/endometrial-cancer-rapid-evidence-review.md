abstract: Incidence and mortality rates associated with endometrial cancer are increasing

  tumors, younger age at menarche, nulliparity, late menopause, and tamoxifen use.
  There are no recommendations for endometrial cancer screening in individuals at
  average risk. Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, is
  the most common symptom. Patients who present with postmenopausal bleeding should
  be evaluated with pelvic ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy. The diagnosis of
  endometrial cancer is made with endometrial biopsy, most often with Pipelle endometrial
  sampling. Dilation and curettage is recommended if an adequate sample cannot be
  obtained, the diagnosis is unclear, or a focal lesion such as an endometrial polyp
  or mass is present. Treatment of early-stage disease is primarily surgical. Radiation
  therapy decreases recurrence rates but not survival rates in early-stage cancers.
  Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and biologic therapy are used to treat advanced endometrial
  cancer, and clinical trials are ongoing. Complementary medicine therapies can improve
  quality of life and survival rates in patients undergoing treatment. Patients should
  be referred to a gynecologic oncologist; early-stage treatment is associated with
  longer survival rates. Endometrial cancer survivors should undergo periodic surveillance
  that includes a history and physical examination.

## Abstract

Incidence and mortality rates associated with endometrial cancer are increasing in the United States. Risk factors include obesity, unopposed estrogen states, estrogen-producing tumors, younger age at menarche, nulliparity, late menopause, and tamoxifen use. There are no recommendations for endometrial cancer screening in individuals at average risk. Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, is the most common symptom. Patients who present with postmenopausal bleeding should be evaluated with pelvic ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made with endometrial biopsy, most often with Pipelle endometrial sampling. Dilation and curettage is recommended if an adequate sample cannot be obtained, the diagnosis is unclear, or a focal lesion such as an endometrial polyp or mass is present. Treatment of early-stage disease is primarily surgical. Radiation therapy decreases recurrence rates but not survival rates in early-stage cancers. Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and biologic therapy are used to treat advanced endometrial cancer, and clinical trials are ongoing. Complementary medicine therapies can improve quality of life and survival rates in patients undergoing treatment. Patients should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist; early-stage treatment is associated with longer survival rates. Endometrial cancer survivors should undergo periodic surveillance that includes a history and physical examination.

Health disparities in pain management tend to affect vulnerable populations. Clinicians must acknowledge the inequities and stigma surrounding chronic pain and need to provide culturally tailored pain management. First-line therapies include nonopioid drugs; long-term opioid...

## Nocturia: Evaluation and Management

Feven W. Getaneh, Rachael D. Sussman, Cheryl B. Iglesia

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void during the night) is clinically significant if it occurs two or more times per night. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies. The addition of pharmacotherapy may be considered. Patients with...

## Endometrial Cancer: Rapid Evidence Review

Carl Bryce, Renee Gazda, Hadass Fuerst

North America has the highest global incidence of endometrial cancer, and the incidence and mortality rates are increasing. Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, is the most common symptom.

## Evaluation of Short and Tall Stature in Children

Rebecca Caro, Paul Savel, Paul Isaiah Moss

The first step in the evaluation of short and tall stature in children is to record and plot growth measurements on a growth curve. Short stature is defined as height that is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean height for age; tall stature is defined as height that...

## Historical Perspectives on Race-Based Medicine in American Family Physician

Kenneth W. Lin, Priscilla Auguste, Christopher W. Bunt, Michelle Nelson

With notable exceptions, past authors and editors of American Family Physician mostly treated race and ethnicity as sociopolitical constructs rather than inherent biologic traits.

## Family Physicians Should Generate Our Own Data and Guidelines to Help Patients With Sinusitis

Global overuse of antibiotics increases antibiotic resistance and unnecessary medication-related adverse events; reducing inappropriate prescribing for acute rhinosinusitis is crucial to limiting the development and spread of antibiotic resistance.

Given the existing evidence, we have assigned a color recommendation of green (benefits greater than harms) for fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin for the treatment of C difficile infections.

## Blood Pressure Targets for Hypertension in People With Chronic Kidney Disease

Tara Devaraj, Karl T. Clebak, Zakary S. Newberry

Having a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher blood pressure target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events,...

## Educational Interventions Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Elizabeth Chiang, Rashmi Rode, Arindam Sarkar

When combined with adverse drug reaction reporting forms and reminder cards, educational interventions improve the overall reporting rate by health care professionals compared with standard spontaneous reporting. Improving hospital-based health care professionals‚Äô access to...

## Buprenorphine-Naloxone for Pregnant Patients With Opioid Use Disorder

Ellen Tran, Sarah Peterson, Dara Jolly, Jon O. Neher

Buprenorphine-naloxone can be used to treat opioid use disorder in pregnant patients. It has an obstetric safety profile similar to those of alternative treatments for this disorder and is associated with a lower rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.

## Bullous Rash on the Face and Neck

A 27-year-old man presented with a rash that was not painful or pruritic.

## Hypertrophic Nodules on the Knuckles

A 44-year-old woman presented with pruritic hand lesions that had been present for several years.

## Lecanemab (Leqembi) for the Slowing of Alzheimer Disease

Lecanemab is an expensive treatment option with noteworthy potential risks and should be prescribed for select patients (ie, with early disease and confirmed amyloid plaque deposition) who understand the ratio of benefit to risk and who can afford it.

## Inappropriate Use of Oral Antiplatelet Drugs

Alan Roth, Andy Lazris, Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering health care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.

## Assessing the Risk of Developing Atrial Fibrillation

How can patients at high risk for developing atrial fibrillation be identified?

## Simple 2 Test for At-Home Gonorrhea and Chlamydia Testing

Tyler J. Raymond, Elizabeth McCarthy Depavloff

When compared with in-office testing, the Simple 2 Test accurately detects gonorrhea and chlamydia in adults 18 years and older who desire at-home testing. It addresses stigma concerns and barriers that patients may encounter when seeking in-clinic screening and improves STI...
