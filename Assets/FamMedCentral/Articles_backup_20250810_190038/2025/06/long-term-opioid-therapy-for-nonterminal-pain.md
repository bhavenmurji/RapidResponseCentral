abstract: Chronic pain, defined as persistent pain lasting longer than 12 weeks, affects
  approximately 20% of US adults and often results in mental and social burdens. In
  general, nonopioid therapies are preferred for chronic nonterminal pain, and opioid
  therapy should not be considered a first-line treatment modality. Health disparities
  in pain management affect vulnerable populations, including racially and ethnically
  marginalized groups and those with cognitive impairment. Clinicians first must acknowledge
  the existing health inequities and the stigma surrounding chronic pain and then
  need to provide culturally tailored pain management. Opioid use should be limited
  to circumstances wherein benefits outweigh risks, such as in cases of nonterminal
  pain refractory to multiple other interventions. Harms of opioid therapy include
  constipation, depression, hormonal dysregulation, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and
  overdose. Given the high prevalence of behavioral health disorders in individuals
  with chronic pain, it is crucial to address mental health in conjunction with pain
  management. Before prescribing opioids, it is essential to review risk factors for
  opioid use disorder and respiratory depression and to set realistic goals for improving
  function. Ongoing monitoring should include assessments of functional progress,
  urine drug testing, and review of data from the state prescription drug monitoring
  program. Buprenorphine is an effective medication for chronic pain management and
  may be safer than full opioid agonists, especially in individuals at risk for opioid
  use disorder, opioid misuse, or overdose.

## Abstract

Chronic pain, defined as persistent pain lasting longer than 12 weeks, affects approximately 20% of US adults and often results in mental and social burdens. In general, nonopioid therapies are preferred for chronic nonterminal pain, and opioid therapy should not be considered a first-line treatment modality. Health disparities in pain management affect vulnerable populations, including racially and ethnically marginalized groups and those with cognitive impairment. Clinicians first must acknowledge the existing health inequities and the stigma surrounding chronic pain and then need to provide culturally tailored pain management. Opioid use should be limited to circumstances wherein benefits outweigh risks, such as in cases of nonterminal pain refractory to multiple other interventions. Harms of opioid therapy include constipation, depression, hormonal dysregulation, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and overdose. Given the high prevalence of behavioral health disorders in individuals with chronic pain, it is crucial to address mental health in conjunction with pain management. Before prescribing opioids, it is essential to review risk factors for opioid use disorder and respiratory depression and to set realistic goals for improving function. Ongoing monitoring should include assessments of functional progress, urine drug testing, and review of data from the state prescription drug monitoring program. Buprenorphine is an effective medication for chronic pain management and may be safer than full opioid agonists, especially in individuals at risk for opioid use disorder, opioid misuse, or overdose.

Kenneth W. Lin, Priscilla Auguste, Christopher W. Bunt, Michelle Nelson

With notable exceptions, past authors and editors of American Family Physician mostly treated race and ethnicity as sociopolitical constructs rather than inherent biologic traits.

## Family Physicians Should Generate Our Own Data and Guidelines to Help Patients With Sinusitis

Global overuse of antibiotics increases antibiotic resistance and unnecessary medication-related adverse events; reducing inappropriate prescribing for acute rhinosinusitis is crucial to limiting the development and spread of antibiotic resistance.

Given the existing evidence, we have assigned a color recommendation of green (benefits greater than harms) for fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin for the treatment of C difficile infections.

## Blood Pressure Targets for Hypertension in People With Chronic Kidney Disease

Tara Devaraj, Karl T. Clebak, Zakary S. Newberry

Having a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher blood pressure target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events,...

## Educational Interventions Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Elizabeth Chiang, Rashmi Rode, Arindam Sarkar

When combined with adverse drug reaction reporting forms and reminder cards, educational interventions improve the overall reporting rate by health care professionals compared with standard spontaneous reporting. Improving hospital-based health care professionals’ access to...

## Buprenorphine-Naloxone for Pregnant Patients With Opioid Use Disorder

Ellen Tran, Sarah Peterson, Dara Jolly, Jon O. Neher

Buprenorphine-naloxone can be used to treat opioid use disorder in pregnant patients. It has an obstetric safety profile similar to those of alternative treatments for this disorder and is associated with a lower rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.

## Bullous Rash on the Face and Neck

A 27-year-old man presented with a rash that was not painful or pruritic.

## Hypertrophic Nodules on the Knuckles

A 44-year-old woman presented with pruritic hand lesions that had been present for several years.

## Lecanemab (Leqembi) for the Slowing of Alzheimer Disease

Lecanemab is an expensive treatment option with noteworthy potential risks and should be prescribed for select patients (ie, with early disease and confirmed amyloid plaque deposition) who understand the ratio of benefit to risk and who can afford it.

## Inappropriate Use of Oral Antiplatelet Drugs

Alan Roth, Andy Lazris, Helen Haskell, John James

A collaboration between AFP and the Lown Institute promotes a vision of delivering health care that is based on the evidence, balanced in its approach, and focused on the patient.
