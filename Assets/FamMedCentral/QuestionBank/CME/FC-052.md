## Question

A44-year-oldmanreportshavingintermittent,sharp,left-sidedchestpainfor3 months. Thepainis nonspecificandoccurswithrestandexertion. Hereportsahistoryofhypertensionanddyslipidemiabut hasnoothermedicalconditions. Hehasnoknowncoronaryarterydisease(CAD). Hispretestprobability for CADusingthe CADConsortium2 calculatorislow. which one of the followingmodalitieswould be themostappropriatefortheevaluationofpossible CAD? Coronaryarterycalciumscoring. Stresstestingwithechocardiography. Stresstestingwithmyocardialperfusionimaging. Stresstestingwithcardiacmagneticresonanceimaging. @ Back

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Forpatientspresentingwithchronicchestpainassociatedwithconsistentprecipitantssuchasexertion oremotionalstress,the CADConsortium2 calculatorprovidesthebestdiscriminationbetweenpatients withlow(lessthan10)andintermediatetohigh(greaterthan10)riskof CAD. Forpatientswithlow- riskstablechestdiscomfortandwithoutknown CAD,itisreasonabletoobtaincoronaryarterycalcium scorestoexcludecalcifiedplaque. Alternatively,anexercisestresstestwithoutimagingcouldbe performedtoexcludeischemia. Forintermediate-orhigh-riskpatientswithstablechestpainandno known CAD,stresstestingwithimaging(ie,echocardiography,myocardialperfusionimagingorcardiac magneticresonanceimaging)isreasonable. e
