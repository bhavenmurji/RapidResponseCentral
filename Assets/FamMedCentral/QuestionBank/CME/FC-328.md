## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Correctiveinsulindosing,alsocalledslidingscaleinsulin,resultsinonlyslightincreasesinaverage glucoselevelscomparedwithbasal-bolusregimensandappearstodecreasetheriskofhypoglycemia. Forpatientswithoutdiabetes,andpatientswithdiabetesnottreatedbyinsulin,correctiveinsulindosing (slidingscaleinsulin)aloneisrecommended.
