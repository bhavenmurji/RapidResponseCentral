Which one of the following statements about the diagnosis of Bell palsy is correct?
Symptoms are bilateral in about 20% of patients.
Onset of symptoms is typically gradual, occurring over one to two weeks.
Patients with Bell palsy are still able to wrinkle their forehead on the affected side.
Patients with Bell palsy have weakness of both the upper and lower facial muscles on the affected
side.
@ Back
ANSWER: D
Bell palsy should be suspected in patients with acute onset of unilateral facial weakness or paralysis
involving the forehead in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities. Symptoms are rarely bilateral
and typically develop acutely (i.e., over one to three days), peak within the first week, and gradually
resolve over weeks to months. Patients who can close their eyes tightly and wrinkle their forehead on the
affected side should be evaluated for a central lesion.
