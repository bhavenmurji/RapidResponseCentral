Which one of the following statements about behavioral health treatments is correct?
Monotherapy is preferred over combination drug therapy for acute severe depression.
Tricyclic antidepressants are the preferred therapy for panic disorder.

Hypnotic agents are first-line therapy for insomnia in adults.
@ Back
ANSWER: CG
Combination therapy using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant with mirtazapine or trazodone is more effective than
monotherapy for acute severe depression. In the treatment of panic disorder, SSRIs show the best
balance of effectiveness vs. risk of adverse events. Patients who discontinued antidepressant
medications were significantly more likely to experience relapse of their depression at one year (number
needed to harm = 6) than those who continued to take their antidepressants. Guidelines recommend
reserving hypnotics for second-line treatment of insomnia in adults.
