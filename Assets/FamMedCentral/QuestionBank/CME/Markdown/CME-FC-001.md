A 32-year-old patient delivers her sixth child vaginally after a pregnancy complicated by gestational
diabetes. After delivery, brisk bleeding and poor uterine tone are noted. Bleeding responds to oxytocin,
misoprostol, tranexamic acid, and uterine balloon tamponade. Blood pressure has decreased from
115/82 to 95/63 mm Hg and heart rate has increased from 88 to 110 beats per minute. According to the
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), which one of the following suggests a
need for transfusion in this patient?
Administration of oxytocin.
Administration of tranexamic acid.
Rule of 30.
Shock index
@ Back
ANSWER: D
After postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion is indicated for patients in shock. A shock index, or the ratio of
heart rate to systolic blood pressure, is a simple way to determine the presence of shock. A shock index
of one or more when heart rate is greater than systolic blood pressure suggests a need for transfusion.
The rule of 30 is another way of measuring shock, but none of the criteria are met in this case.
Transfusion does not depend on the interventions used but depends on the patient’s status.
