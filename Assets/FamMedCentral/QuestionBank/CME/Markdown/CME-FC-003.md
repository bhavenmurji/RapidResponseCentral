statements about point-of-care rapid antigen testing is correct?
It has higher sensitivity in patients who are symptomatic vs. asymptomatic.
It has higher sensitivity during the first week of illness compared with later in the disease course.

All of the above.
@ Back
ANSWER: D
The average sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 were 69.3% (95% Cl,
66.2% to 72.3%) and 99.3% (95% Cl, 99.2% to 99.3%), respectively. Average sensitivity was greater in
those who had symptoms (73.0%; 95% Cl, 69.3% to 76.4%) vs. those without symptoms (54.7%; 95%
Cl, 47.7% to 61.6%). Sensitivity was higher in patients who had symptoms for one week or less (80.9%;
95% Cl, 76.9% to 84.4%) compared with those in their second week of symptoms (53.8%; 95% Cl,
48.0% to 59.6%).
