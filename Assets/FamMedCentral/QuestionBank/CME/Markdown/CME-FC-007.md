Which one of the following statements about prediabetes or diabetes mellitus is correct?
In patients with prediabetes, an intensive lifestyle intervention has been shown to improve long-term
cardiovascular risk.
Most older adults with prediabetes do not develop diabetes.
Drug-induced hypoglycemia is uncommon in frail older adults.
Combination therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy does not improve pain more effectively than
monotherapy
@ Back
ANSWER: B
In patients with prediabetes, neither an intensive lifestyle intervention nor metformin had any impact on
the long-term risk of cardiovascular outcomes. In a cohort study of adults older than 60 years, those with
prediabetes were more likely to become normoglycemic than to develop diabetes or die. More than 75%
of older adults with type 2 diabetes who were living in nursing homes had at least one hypoglycemic
event during two weeks of monitoring, and nearly 50% experienced severe hypoglycemia. There was
greater improvement in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy with subsequent combination therapy
regardless of initial choice of medication
