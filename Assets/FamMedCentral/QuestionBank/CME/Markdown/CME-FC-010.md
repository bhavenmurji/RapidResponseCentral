Which one of the following statements about the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia is correct?
It primarily affects children.
The Philadelphia chromosome (reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22) is found in 90% to
95% of cases.
Bone marrow biopsy is required for diagnosis.
Asymptomatic, early-stage disease may be monitored without treatment.
@ Back
ANSWER: D
Chronic leukemia primarily affects adults, and 70% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are
older than 65 years. Bone marrow biopsy may be performed for treatment and prognostic purposes but is
not required for the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Philadelphia chromosome is found in
90% to 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and is found less often in children and adults
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Asymptomatic, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (i.e.,
absence of anemia and thrombocytopenia and fewer than three areas of lymph node involvement) may
be monitored without treatmen
