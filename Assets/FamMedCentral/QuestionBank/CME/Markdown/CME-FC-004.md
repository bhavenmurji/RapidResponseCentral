ANSWER: CG
The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria recommends imaging with computed
tomography as the first-line modality in most cases of suspected appendicitis in nonpregnant adults, and
MRI as a second-line alternative in most patients. The American College of Radiology recommends initial
imaging in children based on the level of clinical risk; when there is intermediate clinical risk,
ultrasonography is labeled “usually appropriate,” whereas MRI “may be appropriate.” Plain film
radiography is labelled as “usually not appropriate” for this indication.
