According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense (VA/DoD)

Spinal cord stimulation.

ANSWER: CG
Many common treatments for low back pain do not have proven effectiveness in chronic back pain.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are beneficial in chronic low back pain, with a number needed to
treat (NNT) of 6 to reduce pain severity by at least 30% over four to 12 weeks. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is
also effective, with an NNT of 9 for 30% pain reduction.
Nonbenzodiazepine muscle relaxants have not been studied in chronic low back pain, and effects in
acute back pain last for only a few days. Benzodiazepines were not shown to be beneficial in chronic low
back pain in a limited study. Intra-articular facet joint injections and spinal cord stimulation do not offer
benefit in chronic low back pain, whereas medial branch radiofrequency ablation and epidural
corticosteroid injections improve pain without affecting function.
