Which one of the following statements about oral corticosteroid therapy for patients with Bell palsy is
correct?
It has been shown to improve rates of complete recovery in adults.
It is contraindicated in pregnant people.
In children, antivirals are preferred over corticosteroids.
It should be used only for patients with severe symptoms.
@ Back
ANSWER: A
Patients with Bell palsy should be treated with oral corticosteroids, which have been shown to improve
rates of full recovery (number needed to treat = 10). Although there is limited evidence showing that
corticosteroids are beneficial in pregnant patients with Bell palsy, consensus practice is to treat these
patients with corticosteroids early in the disease course, similar to nonpregnant adults. Patients with Bell
palsy should not be treated with antivirals alone. There is strong evidence that antivirals alone have no
effect on recovery.
