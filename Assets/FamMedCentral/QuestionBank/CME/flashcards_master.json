After delivery, brisk bleeding and poor uterine tone are noted. Bleeding responds to oxytocin,\nmisoprostol, tranexamic acid, and uterine balloon tamponade. Blood pressure has decreased from\n115/82 to 95/63 mm Hg and heart rate has increased from 88 to 110 beats per minute. According to the\nInternational Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), which one of the following suggests a\nneed for transfusion in this patient?\nAdministration of oxytocin.\nAdministration of tranexamic acid.\nRule of 30.\nShock index\n@ Back\nANSWER: D\nAfter postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion is indicated for patients in shock. A shock index, or the ratio of\nheart rate to systolic blood pressure, is a simple way to determine the presence of shock. A shock index\nof one or more when heart rate is greater than systolic blood pressure suggests a need for transfusion.\nThe rule of 30 is another way of measuring shock, but none of the criteria are met in this case.\nTransfusion does not depend on the interventions used but depends on the patient\u2019s status.\n@o AAFP_Question_Bank \u2014 Python simple_capture.py \u2014...\nm@i ANKIAPP SCREEN CAPTURER\nInfo\n1.

Bone marrow biopsy may be performed for treatment and prognostic purposes but is\nnot required for the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Philadelphia chromosome is found in\n90% to 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and is found less often in children and adults\nwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Asymptomatic, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (i.e.,\nabsence of anemia and thrombocytopenia and fewer than three areas of lymph node involvement) may\nbe monitored without treatmen\n\u00b0 @ ~ AAFP_Question_Bank \u2014 Python simple_capture.py \u2014...\n[ENTER] to capture card 5 (or 'done'):\nCard 5 captured!\nInfo\n[ENTER] to capture card 6 (or 'done'):\nCard 6 captured!
