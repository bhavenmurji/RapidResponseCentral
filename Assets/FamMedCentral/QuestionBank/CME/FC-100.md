Theyreducetherateofhospitalizationsinthefirstthreemonthsandrecurrenceofatrialfibrillationat threetosixmonthspostablation. Theyreduceall-causemortality. Theyreducetherateofthromboembolicevents. Theyreducetheriskofmyocardialinfarction. @ Back

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Class Iantiarrhythmicsincludeflecainideandpropafenone;class IIImedicationsincludeamiodarone, dofetilide,dronedarone(Multaq),andsotalol.
