Useshareddecision-makingtoconsiderstartingbothlow-doseaspirinandamoderate-intensitystatin. Donotoffertodiscussstartingaspirinoramoderate-intensitystatin. @ Back

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The2019 American Collegeof Cardiology/American Heart Associationguidelinesontheprimary preventionof CVDrecommendthatstatinsbeconsideredinpatientswithanintermediaterisk(10-year estimated CVDriskscoreof7.5 tolessthan20). Guidelinesfromthe U. S. Preventive Services Task Force(USPSTF)recommendstatintherapyforthose40 to75 yearsofagewhohaveoneormore CVD riskfactors(e.g.,dyslipidemia,diabetes,hypertension,smoking)andanestimated10-year CVDrisk scoreof10 orgreater,whereas Veterans Affairs/U. S. Departmentof Defenseguidelinesrecommend initiationwhentheriskexceeds12 andshareddecision-makingwhenapatienthasa6 to12 risk andotherriskfactors. Inthispatient,herhistoryofpreeclampsiaincreasesherrisk. In2022,the USPSTFfoundthatwomen40 to59 yearsofagewhohavea10-year CVDriskof10 orgreaterare mostlikelytohavealifetimebenefitfromaspirin. e
