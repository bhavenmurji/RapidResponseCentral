# Question ITE-2022-150

television. These were not associated with exertion. She has no significant past medical history and she does not take any medications or use illicit substances. On examination you hear a regular rhythm with occasional premature beats. An EKG reveals multiple unifocal PVCs. You order 48-hour Holter monitoring, which shows a 15% PVC burden that is unifocal with no episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time?

## Options

**A.** No further evaluation and reassurance that her palpitations are benign

**B.** Initiation of a β-blocker

**C.** Initiation of flecainide

**D.** Echocardiography

**E.** Left heart catheterization

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Patients found to have a PVC burden >10% are at risk for PVC-induced dilated cardiomyopathy
(PVC-CM). In fact, a PVC burden of 16% has a sensitivity of almost 80% for PVC-CM.
Echocardiography should be performed in patients with a PVC burden >10%. Treatment with
anti-arrhythmic drugs or radiofrequency ablation reverses cardiomyopathy and its associated increase in
morbidity, mortality, and health care (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) spending. Further evaluation for ischemic heart disease may be
performed if the patient has risk factors for ischemia. Symptomatic palpitations may be treated with
-blockers or calcium channel blockers, even in patients with lower PVC burdens and no cardiomyopathy.
Left heart catheterization would not be appropriate.
