# Question ITE-2023-138

A 13-year-old female with a peanut allergy is brought to the urgent care clinic 15 minutes after she was inadvertently exposed to a peanut butter sandwich while at a friendâ€™s house. She develops swelling of the tongue, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Which one of the following should be administered at this time?

## Options

**A.** Subcutaneous epinephrine

**B.** Intramuscular epinephrine

**C.** Intravenous epinephrine

**D.** Intravenous dexamethasone

**E.** Intravenous diphenhydramine

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient is having an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts. Intramuscular epinephrine administered in the outer mid-thigh, preferably via an autoinjector, is the appropriate treatment. The absorption of epinephrine via the subcutaneous route is erratic and results in slow increases in plasma and tissue concentrations compared to the intramuscular route. Intravenous epinephrine needs trained personnel to administer it. Its administration is restricted to refractory cases of anaphylaxis as it is associated with higher cardiovascular complications. Corticosteroids and antihistamines are not first-line treatments.
