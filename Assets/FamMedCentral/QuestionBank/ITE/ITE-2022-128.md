# Question ITE-2022-128

hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypothyroidism has been struggling to lose weight. Her medical conditions are controlled. She asks you if weight loss surgery would be better for her than continued dietary efforts. Which one of the following is true regarding weight loss surgery?

## Options

**A.** Post-surgical dietary recommendations include consuming carbohydrates first at each

**B.** Post-surgical dietary recommendations include drinking fluid with each meal

**C.** Diabetes remission occurs in the majority of patients 2 years after a Roux-en-Y

**D.** Surgical treatment for obesity is equivalent to nonsurgical interventions in overall length

**E.** Surgical treatment for obesity leads to a lifelong need for quarterly laboratory studies

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Surgical treatment for obesity results in remission of diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) mellitus in 60%–80% of patients at 2 years
and sustained remission in 30% at 15 years after a Roux-en-Y procedure. Postsurgical dietary
recommendations include consuming protein first at each meal, rather than carbohydrates, to prevent
malnutrition, and separating consumption of liquids from solids by 15–30 minutes to avoid food passing
through the stomach too quickly, which can lead to a decreased sensation of satiety. Patients who are
treated surgically for obesity rather than with nonsurgical interventions have a longer overall length of
survival. All-cause mortality is decreased by 30%–50% at 7–15 years after surgery. Evaluation for
nutritional deficiencies should be performed quarterly for the first year after surgery; after that, annual
checks are recommended.
