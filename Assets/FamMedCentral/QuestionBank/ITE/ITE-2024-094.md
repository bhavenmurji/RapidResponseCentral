# Question ITE-2024-094

## Question
A 38 -year-old female with uncontrolled hypertension, prediabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome 
sees you for follow -up. Her past surgical history includes a cesarean delivery and a tubal ligation. She 
is concerned because she has not had any menstrual bleeding in the past 5 months. A urine pregnancy 
test today is negative.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** No medication
**B)** Drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (Yaz) daily
**C)** Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol (Jolessa) continuous cycle daily
**D)** Medroxyprogesterone (Provera) for 10 days every 3 months
**E)** A copper IUD (Paragard)

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient has oligomenorrhea in the setting of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Patients with PCOS have a relative excess of estrogen stimulation of the endometrium and are at risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Combined hormonal contraceptive s or medications that contain progesterone reduce this risk by stabilizing the endometrium, as well as improving excess androgen. Intermittent progestin therapy is the most appropriate option for this patient. Levonorgestrel -containing IUDs would also be a n option. Hypertension is a relative contraindication for estrogen use, and this patient does not need hormonal contraception.
