# Question ITE-2022-023

While reviewing laboratory studies for a patient who was recently started on antihypertensive medication, you note new hyperkalemia. Which one of the following medications is most likely to cause this finding?

## Options

**A.** Amlodipine (Norvasc)

**B.** Chlorthalidone

**C.** Hydrochlorothiazide

**D.** Metoprolol

**E.** Olmesartan (Benicar)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Hyperkalemia is a known side effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers such as olmesartan. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, moderately severe to severe heart failure, NSAID use, and older adults. Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia, while amlodipine and metoprolol have no significant effect on potassium levels.
