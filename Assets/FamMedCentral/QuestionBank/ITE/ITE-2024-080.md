# Question ITE-2024-080

## Question
Which one of the following causes of bloody diarrhea should prompt further evaluation for hemolytic 
uremic syndrome?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Campylobacter bacteria
**B)** Entamoeba histolytica
**C)** Salmonella bacteria
**D)** Shiga toxin –producing Escherichia coli
**E)** Shigella bacteria

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a potential serious complication of Shiga toxin – producing Escherichia coli . Frequent monitoring of hemoglobin and platelet counts, electrolytes, and BUN and creatinine levels is recommended to detect early manifestations of HUS. The other listed causes of bloody diarrhea ( Campylobacter bacteria, Entamoeba histolytica , Salmonella bacteria, and Shigella bacteria) are not associated with HUS.
