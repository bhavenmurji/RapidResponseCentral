# Question ITE-2023-025

You are playing in a community league soccer tournament and are asked to evaluate a 30-year-old female. She was in her usual state of health when she suddenly began having difficulty breathing while playing soccer. She tells you that she has had similar episodes in the past. Treatment with an albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) inhaler does not improve her symptoms. On examination you note dyspnea with audible inspiratory wheezing but no increased work of breathing, and she has an oxygen saturation of 98%. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Anaphylaxis

**B.** Exercise-induced asthma

**C.** Foreign body aspiration

**D.** Laryngeal edema

**E.** Vocal cord dysfunction

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Vocal cord dysfunction occurs when the vocal cords close when they should be open, particularly during inspiration. It should be suspected in patients who develop sudden, severe dyspnea that presents with inspiratory stridor or wheezing and is not associated with hypoxia, tachypnea, or increased work of breathing. It is most common in women ages 30â€“40. Anaphylaxis and foreign body aspiration would be unlikely without an antecedent trigger. Exercise-induced asthma usually presents with expiratory wheezing and responds to the use of an albuterol inhaler. Laryngeal edema is usually preceded by signs of illness.
