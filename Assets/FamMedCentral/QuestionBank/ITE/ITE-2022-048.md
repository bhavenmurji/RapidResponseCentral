# Question ITE-2022-048

Heart Association class II heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. His past medical history is notable only for coronary artery disease. His current medications include the following: Aspirin, 81 mg daily Atorvastatin (Lipitor), 80 mg daily Furosemide (Lasix), 40 mg daily Lisinopril (Zestril), 40 mg daily Metoprolol succinate (Toprol-XL), 100 mg daily Spironolactone (Aldactone), 25 mg daily Today he is asymptomatic. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), a blood pressure of 118/75 mm Hg, and a heart rate of 60 beats/min. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which one of the following additional medications would be most appropriate to reduce his risk for worsening heart failure?

## Options

**A.** Dapagliflozin (Farxiga)

**B.** Digoxin

**C.** Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine (BiDil)

**D.** Ivabradine (Corlanor)

**E.** Liraglutide (Victoza)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The prevalence of heart failure has continued to increase due to the aging population in the United States.
Dapagliflozin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of New York Heart Association class II–IV heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction regardless of the presence of diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) mellitus. Notably, recent
studies showed a reduction in the worsening of heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes. Digoxin
may be initiated in patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal therapy with other agents, but it does
not affect morbidity or mortality. Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine provides a mortality benefit in patients
who are unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Ivabradine is a sinus node
modulator and may reduce hospitalization or cardiovascular death in patients with a resting heart rate 70
beats/min who are taking a -blocker at maximal dosage. Liraglutide reduces cardiovascular events in
patients with diabetes but has no role in the treat...
