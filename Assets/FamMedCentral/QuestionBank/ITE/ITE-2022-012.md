# Question ITE-2022-012

cycles, often occurring irregularly more than 40 days apart. She has ongoing struggles with weight gain, acne, and facial hair growth. She states that she is not currently sexually active. Her last Papanicolaou smear 2 years ago was normal. Her vital signs and a physical examination are unremarkable other than a BMI of 36 kg/m2. An office urine pregnancy test is negative. Laboratory evaluation reveals a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%, and normal TSH, prolactin, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Which one of the following is required to confirm the most likely diagnosis?
