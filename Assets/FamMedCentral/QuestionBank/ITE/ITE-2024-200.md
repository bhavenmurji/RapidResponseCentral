# Question ITE-2024-200

## Question
A 55 -year-old male presents for evaluation of recent -onset tinnitus that has adversely affected his 
sleep and concentration. A physical examination including otoscopy is unremarkable.  
 Which one of the following additional findings, if present, would be an indication for hea d imaging?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Associated development of major depressive disorder
**B)** Bilateral hearing loss on audiometry
**C)** Lack of improvement with a trial of a tricyclic antidepressant
**D)** A pulsatile quality of the tinnitus
**E)** Symptom duration >6 months

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
Tinnitus is a common problem that is experienced by up to 25% of adults, although <10% of affected individuals report bothersome symptoms that impair sleep, focus, emotions, or general quality of life. Audiometry should be performed for patients with sever e or persistent symptoms, as hearing loss is a common comorbid finding. Evaluation for potential structural causes with MRI or CT of the temporal bone is indicated for any of the following: a pulsatile quality of the tinnitus, unilateral tinnitus, asymmetr ic hearing loss, or focal neurologic findings. Of the options given in this clinical scenario, only pulsatile tinnitus would provide an indication for head imaging. While patients with tinnitus may be more susceptible to mood disturbances due to the adverse impact on quality of life and functioning that their symptoms may cause, an associated onset of major depression would not provide a reason to order diagnostic head imaging. Bilateral hearing loss on audiometry is often noted in the setting of tinnitus and does not suggest the presence of a structural lesion. No medication strategies have proven effective to treat tinnitus; thus, prescribing a tricyclic antidepressa nt would not be expected to provide benefit. Symptoms often persist for months to years; the duration of symptoms alone does not provide a reason to order head imaging.
