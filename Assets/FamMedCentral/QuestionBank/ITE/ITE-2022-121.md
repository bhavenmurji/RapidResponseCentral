# Question ITE-2022-121

that the neonate was born at 40 weeks gestation to a G2P2002 via vaginal delivery. The mother was noted to be group B Streptococcus  positive, and delivery was complicated by a maternal fever of 38.3°C (101.0°F) and suspected intra-amniotic infection for which the mother received 6 hours of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her membranes ruptured 6 hours before delivery. The nurse notes that the infant has normal vital signs and appears healthy. Which one of the following would be recommended for the newborn to reduce antibiotic administration in this case?

## Options

**A.** Categorical risk factor assessment

**B.** Use of the neonatal early-onset sepsis calculator

**C.** A C-reactive protein level

**D.** A CBC and differential

**E.** Blood cultures

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) has an incidence of 0.5 per 1000 live births according to the CDC, and
group B Streptococcus  (GBS) remains the most common cause. Risk factors for neonatal EOS include
maternal GBS, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrauterine inflammation or infection, and the
combination of inflammation and infection, commonly known as maternal chorioamnionitis, or triple I.
Updated guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists replaced traditional guidelines on prevention of neonatal EOS from the
CDC.

Current guidelines recommend either categorical risk factor assessment, use of the neonatal EOS
calculator, or enhanced observation. However, categorical risk factor assessment, similar to 2002 and 2010
CDC guidelines, would result in blood cultures and administration of antibiotics to any newborn where
there was a maternal intrapartum fever.
The other two approaches (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]), particular...
