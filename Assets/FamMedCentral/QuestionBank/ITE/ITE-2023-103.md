# Question ITE-2023-103

A 12-year-old female with Down syndrome is brought to your office by her parents to establish care after recently moving to the area. Which one of the following laboratory studies should you routinely check on an annual basis?

## Options

**A.** A TSH level only

**B.** A lipid panel only

**C.** A CBC with differential and a lipid panel

**D.** A CBC with differential, and TSH and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels

**E.** A CBC with differential, and serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and TSH levels

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Children with Down syndrome can have iron insufficiency that can lead to long-term neurologic effects. Macrocytosis, which is present in up to one-third of patients with Down syndrome, can mask the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. As a result, a CBC with differential and serum iron and total iron-binding capacity testing are recommended annually. In addition, it is recommended that a TSH level be checked annually as the risk of hypothyroidism increases with age, and by late childhood the incidence of thyroid abnormalities is 50%. Children with Down syndrome do not have an increased risk of hyperlipidemia compared to the general population and do not need annual lipid screening. While children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for celiac disease, there is no evidence that routine screening of IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels in asymptomatic individuals is beneficial.
