# Question ITE-2022-125

amlodipine, 10 mg; lisinopril (Zestril), 20 mg; and hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg. His blood pressure today is 156/92 mm Hg. He says that he forgot to take his medications this morning, and reports that he often forgets to take them. He does not have any specific concerns about side effects. Which one of the following would be most likely to increase this patientâ€™s medication adherence?

## Options

**A.** Taking his medications before bed

**B.** Changing generic amlodipine to branded Norvasc

**C.** Changing generic amlodipine to generic nifedipine

**D.** Replacing lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide with combination

**E.** Adding metoprolol

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Simplifying medication regimens, including using combination medications to decrease the number of pills
a patient must take, has been shown to improve medication adherence in clinical trials (SOR B). Taking
antihypertensive medications before bed has not been shown to improve adherence. Prescribing brand
name medications increases costs, which may decrease adherence. Unless specific side effects are a
concern, changing medications or adding another agent would not be likely to improve adherence.
