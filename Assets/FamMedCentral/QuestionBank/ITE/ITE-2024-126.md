# Question ITE-2024-126

## Question
A 36 -year-old patient presents to the emergency department (ED) for the third time this month for 
fevers ≥101 °F. Extensive workups at past visits have not identified an etiology. The patient does not 
take any medications and has not traveled recently. Tod ay a C -reactive protein level and an 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate are elevated, but a CBC, urinalysis, and chest x -ray are normal. Blood 
cultures are pending and prior cultures have been negative. A complete physical examination is 
unremarkable with no s ign of localized infection or disease. 
 Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Oral naproxen, 500 mg
**B)** Intravenous ceftriaxone, 1 g, plus intravenous azithromycin (Zithromax), 500 mg
**C)** Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET/CT
**D)** for the third time this month for fevers ≥101 °F. Extensive workups at past visits have not identified an etiology. The patient does not take any medications and has not traveled recently. Tod ay a C 
**E)** Bone marrow biopsy

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Fever of unknown origin (FUO) in adults is defined as a clinically documented fever ≥38.3 °C (101 °F) that occurs on multiple occasions without a clear diagnosis. Most cases of FUO are due to common diseases. About 75% of all cases of FUO in adults resolve spontaneously without a determined diagnosis. When an initial workup is unremarkable, imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) - PET/CT is helpful in identifying an inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic cause (SOR B) with sensitivities ranging from 86% to 98% and specificities from 52% to 85%. It is estimated that a diagnosis is found in >50% of patients using FDG -PET/CT. Patients who are neither neutropenic nor severely immunocompromised should not be started on empiric antibiotics (SOR C) or anti -inflammatories, as these have not been shown to effectively treat FUO. Previously, exploratory laparotomy was preferred in the workup of FUO but is now no longer indicated as the accuracy of less invasive diagnostic tests, such as CT, has increased. Bone marrow biopsy is not indicated in this patient with a normal CBC.
