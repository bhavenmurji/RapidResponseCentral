# Question ITE-2024-065

## Question
Hypocalcemia can cause which one of the following?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Constipation
**B)** Hypertension
**C)** Paresthesias
**D)** Respiratory suppression
**E)** Tachycardia

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Hypocalcemia causes generalized neuromuscular irritability, leading to peripheral symmetric paresthesias and muscle spasms that can cause tetany, extrapyramidal symptoms, and seizures. Hypocalcemia can cause QTc prolongation, heart block, and bronchospasm. It can also lead to complications of hypercalciuria such as nephrolithiasis and can trigger psychiatric conditions including anxiety and mania. Hypocalcemia does not cause hypertension, respiratory suppression, or tachycardia. Constipation is more associa ted with hypercalcemia.
