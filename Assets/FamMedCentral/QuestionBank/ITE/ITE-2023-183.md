# Question ITE-2023-183

Which one of the following is a predictor of a poor response to psychotherapy in adolescents with major depressive disorder?

## Options

**A.** High global functioning on assessment

**B.** Hypersomnia

**C.** Inappropriate guilt

**D.** Presence of family conflict

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Predictors of a poor response to psychotherapy in adolescents with major depressive disorder include presence of family conflict, severe depression, low global functioning on assessment, high scores on suicidality measures, coexisting anxiety, distorted thought patterns, and feelings of hopelessness. High global functioning on assessment, hypersomnia, and inappropriate guilt are not predictors of a poor response to psychotherapy in adolescents with major depressive disorder.
