# Question ITE-2023-002

In addition to his obesity diagnosis, his past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and bilateral knee osteoarthritis, which are all adequately controlled with oral medications. His father died of a myocardial infarction (MI), and the patient is worried about his risk of dying of an MI like his father, since they share a similar body habitus and comorbidities. He is concerned about his weight and has researched metabolic surgical interventions on the internet. He is overwhelmed with the options and is seeking your guidance. Given his medical conditions, which one of the following surgical options is the recommended intervention?

## Options

**A.** Adjustable gastric band

**B.** Sleeve gastrectomy

**C.** Roux-en-Y gastric bypass

**D.** Biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

In the single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) approach for asthma control, combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting bronchodilator is used as both controller and rescue medication. SMART is recommended as the preferred therapeutic approach in steps 3 and 4 in the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. Formoterol is the only medication available in the United States recommended for use in SMART therapy due to its rapid onset of action. Budesonide monotherapy, fluticasone/salmeterol, fluticasone/vilanterol, and tiotropium/olodaterol are not appropriate options for SMART in asthma control.
