# Question ITE-2023-017

A 42-year-old male with a history of chronic low back pain managed with extended-release morphine sulfate (MS Contin) comes to your office to discuss fatigue. Among other causes, you consider the impact that long-term opioid therapy may have on the endocrine system. Which one of the following endocrine conditions is most commonly associated with long-term opioid therapy?

## Options

**A.** Hyperprolactinemia

**B.** Hypocortisolism

**C.** Hypogonadism

**D.** Hypoparathyroidism

**E.** Hypothyroidism

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Long-term opioid therapy is associated with several endocrine conditions, the most common of which is hypogonadism. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis that included 52 studies on the endocrine effects of opioids found hypogonadism in 69% of male patients. Lower androgen levels were also found in women, while estradiol was not affected. Menstrual cycle disorders were noted in 87% of premenopausal women taking opioids chronically. Seven of the included studies assessed prolactin levels, which were elevated in 40% of participants. Adrenal insufficiency was noted in 24% of patients. Parathyroid disorders were not included in this manuscript and have not been reported to have an association with opioid use. Two included studies showed lower free T4 levels in those taking opioids, with an estimated incidence of 34%.
