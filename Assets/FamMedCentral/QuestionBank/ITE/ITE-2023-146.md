# Question ITE-2023-146

A young adult who has been one of your patients for several years begins to exhibit symptoms of a thought disorder, and you are concerned about schizophrenia. In a review of the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, your resources refer to positive and negative symptoms. Which one of the following is a negative symptom associated with schizophrenia?

## Options

**A.** Delusions

**B.** Depression

**C.** Disorganized speech

**D.** Hallucinations

**E.** Reduced speech

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that at least one positive and one negative symptom or disorganized behavior be present for 6 months and be severe for at least 1 month. Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech. Negative symptoms include alogia (reduced number of words spoken), blunted affect, avolition (a decrease in motivated, self-initiated, purposeful activities), asociality, and anhedonia. Depression may be present in schizophrenia but is neither a positive nor negative symptom.
