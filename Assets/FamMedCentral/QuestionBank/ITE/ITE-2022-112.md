# Question ITE-2022-112

reports that the pain affects both breasts, particularly during the week prior to her menses. She does not report any redness, nipple discharge, or fever. This is the first time the patient has presented for evaluation of this problem. In addition to conservative measures, which one of the following would be most appropriate to manage the patientâ€™s pain without interfering with fertility?

## Options

**A.** Diclofenac gel (Voltaren Arthritis Pain)

**B.** Danazol

**C.** Goserelin (Zoladex)

**D.** Tamoxifen (Soltamox)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Mastalgia is a common symptom requiring evaluation in the primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) care setting. Cyclic mastalgia
accounts for about two-thirds of all breast pain and is thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the
breast tissues to hormonal stimulation during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Topical NSAIDs such
as diclofenac are the first-line pharmacologic treatment for mastalgia (SOR B). Danazol is the only drug
that is approved by the FDA for treatment of mastalgia, but it is poorly tolerated due to menorrhagia,
muscle cramps, weight gain, and other androgenic effects. Goserelin is only indicated for severe,
refractory mastalgia. Tamoxifen is more effective and better tolerated than danazol, but is associated with
hot flashes, vaginal discharge, venous thromboembolism, endometrial cancer, and teratogenicity.
