# Question ITE-2023-022

A 70-year-old male presents with his wife because they are concerned that he may be developing dementia. Among other symptoms, he has a resting tremor and describes detailed hallucinations that are colorful, vivid, and include animals. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Alzheimer disease

**B.** Dementia with Lewy bodies

**C.** Frontotemporal dementia

**D.** Normal pressure hydrocephalus

**E.** Vascular dementia

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) include: • delirium-like fluctuations in cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness • hallucinations • spontaneous parkinsonism features such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, or rigidity • REM sleep behavior disorder (recurrent dream enactment behavior that includes movements mimicking dream content and absence of normal REM sleep atonia) Vivid, colorful hallucinations occur in about 80% of patients with DLB. They can be three-dimensional and tend to include people, children, or animals. Patients are generally able to report these hallucinations to physicians. While hallucinations can occur in other types of dementia, they are a clinical signpost to the diagnosis of DLB.
