# Question ITE-2022-135

virus (HCV) testing. He reports that he experimented with intravenous drugs in college but never developed a habit. He consumes 1â€“2 alcoholic drinks a week and is a nonsmoker. He is not married but is in a monogamous, heterosexual relationship. Which one of the following would confirm active hepatitis C infection?

## Options

**A.** Anti-HCV antibody testing

**B.** AST and ALT levels

**C.** An AST/platelet ratio index

**D.** A CBC with differential and peripheral smear

**E.** HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient is at risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to his history of intravenous drug use. The
initial screening test for HCV is anti-HCV antibody testing, and a positive result could indicate either a
prior infection that cleared or an active infection. If the antibody test is positive, HCV RNA polymerase
chain reaction testing is the next step to confirm an active infection. AST and ALT levels and a CBC
should be obtained if the patient is diagnosed with an active HCV infection. The AST/platelet ratio index (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-index.md|2023 05 Index]])
is a screening test for hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.
