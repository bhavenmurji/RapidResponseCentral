# Question ITE-2022-152

undecided about breastfeeding versus bottle feeding and asks if breastfeeding provides any benefits for her own health. You advise her that breastfeeding would decrease her risk of later developing

## Options

**A.** colon cancer

**B.** diabetes mellitus

**C.** lung cancer

**D.** osteoarthritis

**E.** recurrent respiratory infections

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Breastfeeding provides many health benefits to both the mother and the infant. Maternal benefits include
a decreased risk of developing cardiometabolic disease, including diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) mellitus, hypertension, and
cardiovascular disease; a decreased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer; and a decreased risk of
postpartum depression. A link has not been established between breastfeeding and a reduced risk of
developing colon cancer or lung cancer or osteoarthritis later in life. While breastfeeding may reduce the
infantâ€™s risk of respiratory disease, this is not an expected benefit for the mother.
