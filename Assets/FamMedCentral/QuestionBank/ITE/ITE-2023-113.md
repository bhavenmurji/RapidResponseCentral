# Question ITE-2023-113

A 40-year-old male presents to the urgent care clinic with a 2-day history of a progressive inability to walk. His husband is concerned that he has Guillain-Barré syndrome. Which one of the following, if present in this patient, would be concerning for Guillain-Barré syndrome?

## Options

**A.** Afferent pupillary defect

**B.** Asymmetric flaccid weakness

**C.** Muscle spasticity

**D.** Nystagmus

**E.** Symmetric hyporeflexia

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a common cause of acute weakness. While the clinical presentation can vary, patients commonly present with progressive symmetric ascending flaccid weakness and symmetrical hyporeflexia or areflexia. Asymmetric flaccid weakness and muscle spasticity are not seen in GBS. While patients may have cranial nerve findings, those are not common. Nystagmus is not typically associated with GBS.
