# Question ITE-2022-003

ulcer disease, and you refer him for endoscopy, which shows a small duodenal ulcer. The endoscopist also notes some small esophageal varices without red wale signs. Further evaluation confirms that the patient has compensated cirrhosis in the setting of alcohol use disorder. He readily accepts this diagnosis and enters an Alcoholics Anonymous program. His ulcer symptoms resolve with antibiotic therapy for Helicobacter pylori . He says he has abstained from alcohol for 6 weeks, and he would like to further reduce his risks from cirrhosis. The most appropriate next step in the management of his esophageal varices would be

## Options

**A.** octreotide (Sandostatin)

**B.** omeprazole (Prilosec)

**C.** propranolol

**D.** endoscopic variceal ligation

**E.** repeat endoscopy in 1–2 years

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage is an important consideration in the management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of patients
with cirrhosis. Although this patient's varices were diagnosed incidentally, patients with cirrhosis and
clinically significant portal hypertension should be screened for varices every 2–3 years with
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). EGD can be deferred in patients with platelet counts <150,000/mm3
and transient elastography with liver stiffness <20 kPa. Once esophageal varices are identified, the criteria
for initiating prophylaxis to prevent variceal hemorrhage is based on the risk of bleeding. Findings
associated with a high risk of bleeding include small varices in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, small
varices with red wale signs (thinning of the variceal wall), and medium to large varices. Patients with small
varices not meeting these criteria have a low risk of hemorrhage and do not require prophylaxis. They
should be rescreened with EGD every 1–2 years.
For patients requi...
