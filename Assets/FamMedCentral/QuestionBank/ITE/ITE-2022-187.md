# Question ITE-2022-187

when descending stairs and jumping. He is active in sports but has no recent history of injury. On examination you note tenderness and swelling over the tibial tuberosity, but no redness or warmth. Which one of the following would be most appropriate before initiating treatment?

## Options

**A.** No imaging

**B.** Plain film radiographs

**C.** Ultrasonography

**D.** MRI

**E.** A bone scan

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has apophysitis at the insertion of the patellar tendon at the tibial tubercle. The clinical
diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease is based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) on history and examination, and imaging is not needed
initially. If this patientâ€™s symptoms persist despite treatment, or if there are atypical features or a history
of trauma, imaging would be appropriate. Plain film radiography or ultrasonography would be a good first
step, with ultrasonography offering the advantage of no radiation exposure. MRI and a bone scan would
not be indicated.
