# Question ITE-2023-041

A 56-year-old male with hypertension and a BMI of 39 kg/m2 comes to your office for follow-up after a full-night study in the sleep laboratory for evaluation of snoring and fatigue. The study revealed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 12 events per hour of sleep. He has several questions about his treatment options. He reports that he is very concerned about this problem and is willing to try anything, but a family member suggested he consider the newer procedures. In addition to diet, exercise, and behavioral modifications, which one of the following would be the most appropriate intervention at this time?

## Options

**A.** An oral appliance

**B.** CPAP therapy

**C.** Hypoglossal nerve stimulation

**D.** Pharyngeal soft-tissue modification

**E.** Bariatric surgery

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) based on an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 in the presence of symptoms and cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension. CPAP therapy is considered the most effective treatment for OSA if used correctly and consistently and is the first-line treatment recommendation. However, many patients struggle with tolerating CPAP, which results in poor adherence and undertreatment. An oral appliance may be tried for mild sleep apnea (an AHI of 5 to <15) and is better than no treatment for patients who do not tolerate CPAP. Given the development of newer surgical treatments, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that clinicians discuss referrals for additional treatments if adult patients with obesity cannot tolerate or do not accept CPAP. The AASM recommends that clinicians who treat OSA discuss referral to a sleep surgeon who can perform upper airway surgery (pharyngeal soft-tissue modification, skeletal modification, and upper airway stimulation such as hypoglossal nerve stimulation) with adult patients who have a BMI >40 kg/m2 and are intolerant or unaccepting of CPAP (Strong Recommendation). It also recommends discussing referral to a bariatric surgeon with adult OSA patients with obesity (class II/III, BMI 35 kg/m2) who are intolerant or unaccepting of CPAP (Strong Recommendation). Discussing a referral does not necessarily have to result in a referral, but patients should be informed that other viable alternative treatments exist and can reduce disease burden.
