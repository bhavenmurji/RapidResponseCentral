# Question ITE-2023-186

A 63-year-old female presents to your office for evaluation of a lesion on her left forearm (shown below). She reports that it started as a “pimple” about a month ago and has since increased in size. It is not painful or itchy and has not bled. She has no personal or family history of skin cancer. Which one of the following should you recommend for management of this lesion?

## Options

**A.** Reassurance that the lesion is benign

**B.** Intralesional corticosteroid injection

**C.** Cryotherapy

**D.** Shallow shave biopsy

**E.** Excisional biopsy with 3- to 5-mm margins

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Keratoacanthomas begin as round, firm papules that grow rapidly over weeks to months into dome-shaped nodules with keratin-filled centers. They cannot be distinguished clinically or histologically from squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, they should have early definitive management such as excisional biopsy with 3- to 5-mm margins. Mohs surgery may be considered if tissue sparing is desired for cosmetic reasons. Reassurance, intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryotherapy, and shallow shave biopsy are not adequate management strategies.
