# Question ITE-2022-033

treated with hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine (Norvasc), and losartan (Cozaar). He also has type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and empagliflozin (Jardiance). Laboratory findings are significant for an LDL-cholesterol level of 167 mg/dL and you prescribe simvastatin (Zocor), 80 mg daily. At a follow-up visit 3 months later he tells you that he stopped taking the simvastatin after a week due to muscle pain and weakness. Which one of the following medications in this patient’s current regimen most likely contributed to his risk for developing statin-induced myopathy?

## Options

**A.** Amlodipine

**B.** Empagliflozin

**C.** Hydrochlorothiazide

**D.** Losartan

**E.** Metformin

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Most statins are metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes. In patients on
statin therapy, concurrent use of other medications that are also metabolized by this system, including
amiodarone, calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, certain anti-HIV medications, and certain
antifungal medications, can increase the risk of complications such as statin-induced myopathy. In this
patient, only simvastatin and amlodipine are metabolized by CYP3A4. Losartan is metabolized by
cytochrome P450 enzymes other than 3A4 (2C9), and this patient’s other medications are metabolized by
different mechanisms (empagliflozin) or not significantly metabolized (hydrochlorothiazide and
metformin).
