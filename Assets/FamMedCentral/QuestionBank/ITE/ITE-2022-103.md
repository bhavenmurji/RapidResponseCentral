# Question ITE-2022-103

contraceptive management. You note that she is no longer taking hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and has not seen her rheumatologist in over a year. She reports generalized fatigue and intermittent joint pain. She is agreeable to obtaining laboratory studies at today’s visit. In addition to checking anti–double-stranded DNA, complement levels, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a C-reactive protein level, a CBC, and a comprehensive metabolic panel, which one of the following laboratory tests would be most helpful in monitoring her disease activity?

## Options

**A.** An anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide level

**B.** An antinuclear antibody titer

**C.** A creatine kinase level

**D.** A fasting lipid panel

**E.** A urinalysis with microscopic examination

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) follow a relapsing-remitting course, and
management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) requires monitoring clinical symptoms and laboratory studies. Prolonged remission and
persistently active disease are both infrequent. In addition to monitoring anti–double-stranded DNA,
complement levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein levels, WBC counts, platelet
counts, serum creatinine levels, and glomerular filtration rates, monitoring urine studies for proteinuria
is important to assess disease activity over time. Lupus nephritis is a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality associated with SLE. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide and creatine kinase levels are associated
with rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis, respectively. These tests may assist in ruling out other
autoimmune diseases but are not helpful once a diagnosis of SLE is made. While an antinuclear antibody
(ANA) titer is helpful in making a diagnosis of SLE, it does not assist...
