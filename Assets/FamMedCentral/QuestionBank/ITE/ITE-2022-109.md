# Question ITE-2022-109

falling while skiing. She has pain and tenderness along the lateral aspect of the affected elbow and limited range of motion of the elbow and forearm. Radiographs confirm a nondisplaced fracture of the radial head. Which one of the following would be most likely to produce satisfactory outcomes?

## Options

**A.** Immobilization for 3 days followed by range-of-motion exercises

**B.** A long arm posterior splint for 6 weeks

**C.** A long arm cast for 6 weeks

**D.** Referral to an orthopedist for cast placement

**E.** Referral to an orthopedist for surgical repair

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has a nondisplaced radial head fracture. Current evidence supports a brief period of
immobilization followed by early range-of-motion exercises to avoid decreased range of motion. This
results in good outcomes in 85%â€“95% of patients. Immobilization for 6 weeks using either a long arm
posterior splint or a long arm cast is not necessary. More advanced or displaced fractures may require a
referral to an orthopedist for cast placement or operative repair, but nondisplaced radial head fractures can
be managed by primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) care physicians.
