# Question ITE-2023-071

You see a 5-year-old female for the first time for a new patient visit. Her mother notes that she tires easily and sometimes cannot keep up with other children her age. Laboratory studies reveal the following: WBCs                               6500/mm3 (N 5000–14,500) RBCs                                5.6 million/mm3 (N 3.90–5.30) Hemoglobin                           9.1 g/dL (N 11.5–15.5) Hematocrit                            27% (N 34–40) Platelets                              220,000/mm3 (N 150,000–450,000) Mean corpuscular volume                68 m3 (N 75–87) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin             28 pg/cell (N 24–30) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration                         34 g/dL (N 32–36) Red cell distribution width                11% (N 11.5–15.0) Ferritin                              150 ng/mL (N 7–140) Transferrin saturation                    40% (N 15–50) A peripheral smear shows target cells, microcytic cells, red cell fragments, teardrop cells, and nucleated RBCs. Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s anemia?

## Options

**A.** Aplastic anemia

**B.** Iron deficiency

**C.** Megaloblastic anemia

**D.** Myelofibrosis

**E.** Thalassemia minor

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient most likely has thalassemia minor and will need further genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. Thalassemia minor is associated with microcytic anemia. Thalassemia can be differentiated from iron deficiency based on low red cell distribution width (RDW), elevated reticulocyte count, normal or slightly elevated RBC count, slightly elevated ferritin, and nucleated RBCs on peripheral smear. Aplastic anemia is associated with a poor reticulocyte response and low counts. Iron deficiency is associated with an elevated RDW; a low reticulocyte count; and low RBC, ferritin, and transferrin saturation levels. Megaloblastic anemia is typically associated with an elevated mean corpuscular volume. Myelofibrosis is associated with bone marrow failure and pancytopenia.
