# Question ITE-2022-102

erythema of his right foot. His medical history is significant for peripheral artery disease and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes with diabetic neuropathy. Significant vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), a blood pressure of 155/90 mm Hg, and a pulse rate of 85 beats/min. A physical examination is most notable for a draining ulcer on the ball of his right foot. The edema and erythema are limited to his right foot and he has no calf tenderness. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulses are present but diminished at the right ankle. Sensation to monofilament testing of his right foot is diffusely diminished, which is consistent with his baseline. The best initial imaging test of the foot ulcer would be

## Options

**A.** radiography

**B.** ultrasonography

**C.** CT

**D.** MRI

**E.** technetium 99m bone scintigraphy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has osteomyelitis until proven otherwise. A radiograph of his right foot is the best initial test
to look for evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of this diagnosis. In most treatment settings, radiography is much easier to obtain than
ultrasonography, CT, MRI, or technetium 99m bone scintigraphy. In addition, it is generally considerably
less expensive than the other options listed. A radiograph also allows the physician to rule out other bony
pathologies. MRI is useful if the radiograph is inconclusive, and is more helpful than radiography for
determining bony versus soft-tissue infection. CT may be used in cases where MRI is contraindicated.
Ultrasonography is not useful for evaluating bony lesions. Bone scintigraphy has low sensitivity,
particularly in the setting of recent trauma or surgery.
