# Question ITE-2024-011

## Question
Which one of the following medications is most likely to interfere with the results of screening for 
primary hyperaldosteronism?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Amlodipine (Norvasc)
**B)** Hydrochlorothiazide
**C)** Lisinopril (Zestril)
**D)** Metoprolol
**E)** Spironolactone (Aldactone)

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Primary aldosteronism is a common cause of resistant hypertension, although it is largely underrecognized. Initial screening is accomplished through simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone and renin levels. An elevated plasma aldosterone to renin ra tio identifies patients with probable aldosteronism who may then undergo confirmatory testing if clinically indicated; in some cases, additional testing is not needed to reach a diagnosis. Medications that most significantly impact the renin - angiotensin -aldosterone system, particularly mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone, ideally should be withheld for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to testing for primary aldosteronism. Other antihypertensive medication classes, including ACE inhibitor s, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, Î²-blockers, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, also may interfere with test results, although less significantly than mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.
