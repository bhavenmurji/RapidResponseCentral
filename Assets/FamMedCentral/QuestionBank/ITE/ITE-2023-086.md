# Question ITE-2023-086

A parent brings their 2-month-old infant to your office for a routine well check. The infant, who was born at full term, is formula fed and the parent is concerned about vomiting that occurs after every feeding. After taking a history and examining the infant you diagnose uncomplicated reflux. The next appropriate intervention would be

## Options

**A.** prone positioning for sleep

**B.** celiac testing

**C.** a trial of thickened feeds

**D.** a trial of an acid suppressor

**E.** abdominal ultrasonography

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

For uncomplicated reflux, a trial of thickened feeds and/or switching to a soy formula would be appropriate, as a milk protein allergy can present similarly. Prone positioning for sleep is not recommended for infants due to increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Celiac testing may not be helpful in a formula-fed infant who has not been exposed to gluten-containing grains. A trial of an acid suppressor should take place if symptoms are not improved after omitting cowâ€™s milk formula and thickening feeds. Abdominal ultrasonography would be indicated for bilious forceful vomiting, failure to thrive, or other clinical signs that would suggest pyloric stenosis. 34
