# Question ITE-2024-037

## Question
A 42 -year-old female sees you for routine follow -up of adrenal insufficiency diagnosed 2 years ago. 
Today she reports a 2 -month history of fatigue, decreased energy, difficulty concentrating, and 
nausea. She has also had an unintentional 5 -lb weight loss over the past 3 months. She takes oral 
hydrocortisone, 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon. She is adherent to her medication 
regimen and has not ha d any illnesses in the past year.  
 Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial step in the management of this 
patient’s adrenal insufficiency?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Increasing the hydrocortisone dosage
**B)** A random cortisol level
**C)** A cortisol stimulation test
**D)** CT of the adrenal glands

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Hydrocortisone is the preferred glucocorticoid for replacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency, and the goal of treatment is to use the lowest dosage of glucocorticoids to control symptoms. After initial replacement, the management of chronic adrenal insufficiency includes assessment of signs and symptoms of under - or overreplacement. This patient has signs and symptoms of underreplacement including fatigue, weight loss, nausea, decreased energy, and difficulty concentrating. Her glucocorticoid dosage should be increased by 2.5 –5 mg daily and her symptoms reassessed in 1 week. Measurement of an early morning corticotropin (ACTH) level is helpful in assessing for overreplacement as indicated by a low level; however, an elevated corticotropin level is not nec essarily indicative of underreplacement. Checking a random cortisol level is typically not necessary. A cortisol stimulation test is useful in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency but not in monitoring replacement after diagnosis. CT of the adrenal glands can be useful in evaluating the etiolog y of adrenal insufficiency but not in the ongoing management of glucocorticoid replacement therapy.
