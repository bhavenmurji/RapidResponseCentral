# Question ITE-2023-129

A 48-year-old female with alcohol use disorder presents to your clinic 2 days after she has stopped drinking alcohol. She reports some mild anxiety, sweating, and insomnia. On examination her vital signs are stable and she does not have a tremor. She has no history of alcohol withdrawal–related seizures or delirium. Which one of the following medications is most appropriate for treating her alcohol withdrawal syndrome? 48 50 ---

## Options

**A.** Atenolol (Tenormin)

**B.** Chlordiazepoxide

**C.** Diazepam (Valium)

**D.** Gabapentin (Neurontin)

**E.** Valproate

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Patients at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal who can safely be treated in an outpatient setting include those who are <65 years of age and who have no history of alcohol withdrawal–related seizures or delirium, no multiple prior withdrawal episodes, no comorbid illness, and no marked autonomic hyperactivity on presentation. Mild symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome include mild to moderate anxiety, sweating, and insomnia but no tremor. Moderate symptoms include moderate anxiety, sweating, and insomnia with mild tremor. Severe symptoms include severe anxiety and moderate to severe tremor but no confusion, hallucinations, or seizures that are indicative of complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms. For patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome who have mild symptoms and minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal, a nonbenzodiazepine anticonvulsant such as gabapentin or carbamazepine is recommended. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment for moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and -blockers can be used as adjunctive therapy with benzodiazepines. Valproate should not be used as monotherapy for withdrawal.
