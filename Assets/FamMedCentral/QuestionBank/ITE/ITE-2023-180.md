# Question ITE-2023-180

A 58-year-old female with coronary artery disease and alcohol use disorder presents with progressive shortness of breath over the past 3 weeks. A chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions that are greater on the right side. Laboratory studies, including pleural fluid analysis, show the following: Serum protein                          5.5 g/dL (N 6.0–8.0) Serum LDH                           305 IU/L (N 105–333) Plasma glucose                         88 mg/dL (N 70–100) Pleural fluid protein                     2.9 g/dL Pleural fluid LDH                       295 IU/L Pleural fluid glucose                     51 mg/dL Which one of the following is the most likely cause of the effusion?

## Options

**A.** Cirrhosis of the liver

**B.** Congestive heart failure

**C.** COPD

**D.** Malignancy

**E.** Pulmonary embolism

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The modified Light’s criteria are used to determine whether pleural effusions are transudative or exudative. This fluid is exudative as defined by a pleural fluid protein to serum protein ratio >0.5, a pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH ratio >0.6, and a pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum. Lung malignancy is a cause of exudative pleural effusions. Cirrhosis and congestive heart failure cause transudative rather than exudative effusions. COPD does not cause pleural effusions. This fluid also has low glucose, which suggests malignancy or infection rather than pulmonary embolism.
