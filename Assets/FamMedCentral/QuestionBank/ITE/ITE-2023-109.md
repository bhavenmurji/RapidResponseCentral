# Question ITE-2023-109

A 56-year-old female comes to your office because she thinks she has a herniated disc in her lower back causing sciatica. She has electric pain shooting down her left leg all the way to her toes, and she requests MRI to see if she needs surgery. She has not had any injury, saddle anesthesia, or changes in bowel or bladder habits. On examination she has 2+ symmetric deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremities, a negative bilateral straight leg raising test, and a positive log roll test. Her pain is worse with external rotation of the left hip. You suspect piriformis syndrome. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management?

## Options

**A.** Reassurance only

**B.** MRI of her lumbar spine

**C.** Injection of the piriformis muscle with a corticosteroid and local anesthetic

**D.** Referral to a physical therapist

**E.** Referral to an orthopedic surgeon

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient’s history and the physical examination are classic for piriformis syndrome and she will likely recover with physical therapy and home exercises. Reassurance only is not the best management option for piriformis syndrome. An MRI may be warranted later, but it is not the first step in the workup and treatment in this patient’s case. Injecting the piriformis muscle with a corticosteroid and local anesthetic is inappropriate therapy for this condition. This patient does not have any red-flag signs for lumbar radiculopathy and therefore does not require referral to an orthopedic surgeon at this time.
