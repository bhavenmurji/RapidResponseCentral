# Question ITE-2022-089

your advice on strategies to help prevent obesity and eating disorders in her 12-year-old daughter. Which one of the following strategies should be incorporated?

## Options

**A.** Implementing a diet of moderate calorie restriction for healthy adolescents and adults

**B.** Having more frequent discussions regarding weight control and healthy eating

**C.** Limiting home-prepared dinners to 1–2 times per week

**D.** Eating meals together as a family 7 times per week

**E.** Watching television during mealtimes

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A higher frequency of family meals is associated with improved dietary quality, as evidenced by increased
consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Eating meals together as a family on most days or every day
is protective against purging and binge eating, as well as frequent dieting, which is a risk factor for both
obesity and eating disorders. Parental talk about weight revolving around their children or their own dieting
is linked to becoming overweight. Meals that are home-prepared and undistracted are also beneficial to
maintaining healthy weight and attitudes toward food.
