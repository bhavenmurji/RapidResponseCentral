# Question ITE-2022-199

followed by an episode of syncope after drinking four beers at a hotel bar while on vacation. He says that he was hospitalized briefly, and an electric shock was administered in the emergency department after medications were given. On discharge he was told that he had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation but that an echocardiogram was normal. He was advised to follow up promptly with his personal physician. An EKG performed in your office is shown below. Which one of the following would you recommend for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Aspirin

**B.** Oral flecainide to be taken if a similar episode occurs in the future

**C.** Oral metoprolol therapy

**D.** Warfarin therapy

**E.** Catheter ablation therapy

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This EKG shows a short P-R interval with a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex in the precordial leads.
These findings are classic for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. In symptomatic patients with
sustained ventricular tachycardias, especially with the more dangerous paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
catheter ablation is the preferred therapy. Up to 95% success has been reported.
Aspirin alone would be ineffective for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation, and would not be indicated for
this young patient with no other risk factors for stroke. “Pill-in-the-pocket” therapy with agents such as
flecainide or propafenone can be used for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in structurally normal hearts.
However, they are not the treatment of choice with WPW syndrome.

conduction on the accessory pathway. This can lead to more rapid atrial fibrillation or even degenerat...
