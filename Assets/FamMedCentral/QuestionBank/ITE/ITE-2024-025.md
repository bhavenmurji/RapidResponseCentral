# Question ITE-2024-025

## Question
A 69 -year-old female comes to your office for a routine health maintenance visit. She drinks 1 glass 
of wine every night with dinner, walks 30 minutes per day, and does not smoke. Her medical history 
is significant for knee osteoarthritis. She has never had surgery and does not take any medications except as-needed ibuprofen.  
 On examination she has a BMI of 28 kg/m
2, a blood pressure of 112/78 mm Hg, and a heart rate of 
82 beats/min. Other than bilateral knee crepitus, the physical examination findings are unremarkable. 
Laboratory findings include:  
Total cholesterol  165 mg/dL  
HDL -cholesterol  32 mg/dL  
LDL -cholesterol  109 mg/dL  
Triglycerides  120 mg/dL  
Hemoglobin A 1c 7.5%  
Her calculated 10 -year risk of cardiovascular disease is 13.2%.  
 
In addition to appropriately treating her diabetes mellitus, which one of the following is 
recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force regarding statin use in this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** No statin at this time
**B)** A low -intensity statin
**C)** A moderate -intensity statin
**D)** A high -intensity statin

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, statin therapy with a moderate - intensity dosage is recommended for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults 40 –75 years of age with a CVD risk of ≥10% with 1 or more CVD risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or smoking tobacco (B recommendation). Not initiating statin therapy increases the cardiovascular risk for this patient with identified CVD risk factors. Initiating low -intensity statin therapy is not sufficient. This patient does not have any additional risk factors that would require a high-intensity statin and her calculated 10 -year risk of CVD is <20%.
