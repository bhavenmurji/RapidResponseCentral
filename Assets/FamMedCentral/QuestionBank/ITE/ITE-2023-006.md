# Question ITE-2023-006

A 33-year-old female presents to your office concerned about feeling fatigued for the past few months. She says that she feels cold often, has intermittent joint discomfort, and has gained 5 lb. She has not experienced any pain or problems swallowing. She gave birth to her youngest child almost 3 years ago, and she recently started an oral contraceptive. She has not had any recent illnesses. Her family history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis. A physical examination reveals a mild goiter but is otherwise unremarkable. Her vital signs are stable. A CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel are normal. A TSH level is 6.48 U/mL (N

## Options



## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Thyroiditis, a general term for inflammation of the thyroid gland, is associated with thyroid gland dysfunction. It is classified based on clinical symptoms: painless or painful, acute or subacute, and underlying etiology (medication-induced, infection, radiation-induced, or autoimmune). The most common forms of thyroiditis include Hashimoto, subacute, and postpartum. Thyroiditis often results in a triphasic disease pattern of thyroid dysfunction: hyperthyroidism due to the release of preformed thyroid hormone from damaged thyroid cells followed by hypothyroidism when the thyroid stores are depleted. Eventually normal thyroid function is restored, or the patient develops permanent hypothyroidism. This patient presents with symptoms commonly seen in thyroid disease. Further testing reveals elevated TSH and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) levels. Elevated TPO levels are found in 95% of patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. In addition, this patient’s family history includes rheumatoid arthritis, another autoimmune disease, making Hashimoto thyroiditis the most likely diagnosis. Treatment is lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. Several medications are linked to thyroiditis, including lithium, amiodarone, interferon-alfa, interleukin-2, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, there is no proven link between oral contraceptives and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 1 year of delivery, miscarriage, or medical abortion, not 2–3 years. Subacute thyroiditis is self-limited and often occurs after upper respiratory infections, causing thyroid pain and dysphagia due to inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles.
