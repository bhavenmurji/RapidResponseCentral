# Question ITE-2023-066

A healthy 23-year-old presents for a physical examination required for entrance to nursing school. The patientâ€™s vital signs and a physical examination are unremarkable. To complete the immunization requirements, you administer Tdap and varicella vaccines. The nursing school requests tuberculosis (TB) test results. Which one of the following would be most appropriate regarding TB testing?

## Options

**A.** No testing because the patient is asymptomatic

**B.** A sputum culture

**C.** A tuberculin skin test

**D.** An interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA, QuantiFERON-TB Gold)

**E.** A chest radiograph

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Initial tuberculosis screening is recommended for all health care providers upon hire and extends to health care students. Recommended tests for initial screening include the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA, QuantiFERON-TB Gold) and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST can be affected by live virus vaccines given within the previous 4 weeks. Since this patient received a live virus vaccine (varicella), a TST may be falsely negative. The IGRA, which is not affected by prior live vaccines, would be most appropriate for this patient. Additional advantages to the assay test include higher sensitivity and specificity than the TST, the need for only one visit, and objective results. While the TST is less expensive, there is risk for subjective or misread results and a requirement of two clinic visits. A sputum culture and a chest radiograph are only indicated in the setting of positive screening results with the above-mentioned tests.
