# Question ITE-2022-095

mild vision problems. His brother lost his vision due to glaucoma and encouraged the patient to seek care. Which one of the following is most consistent with the typical vision changes of glaucoma?

## Options

**A.** Central vision loss with peripheral sparing

**B.** Halos and decreased night vision

**C.** Intermittent complete blackening of the visual field

**D.** Patchy peripheral vision blurring

**E.** Sudden scattered floaters

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Glaucoma and other common eye conditions cause a range of visual disturbances. Glaucoma is typically
associated with blurring of peripheral vision as elevated pressure in the eye pushes on the periphery of the
ophthalmic nerve. Central vision loss with peripheral sparing is classically seen with macular degeneration.
Halos and decreased night vision are classic problems for patients with cataracts. Intermittent complete
blackening of the visual field may be seen with ischemia associated with stroke or temporal arteritis.
Sudden scattered floaters should raise concern for retinal detachment.
