# Question ITE-2023-014

Which one of the following screenings should you recommend for this patient at this time?

## Options

**A.** Carotid stenosis

**B.** Glaucoma

**C.** HIV

**D.** Testicular cancer

**E.** Vitamin D deficiency

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient presents with symptoms and examination findings that are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with significant medical comorbidity, and he is stable for outpatient treatment. Medical comorbidities in this context include chronic heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease; diabetes mellitus; alcohol use disorder; cancer; or asplenia. One option for treatment in this situation is monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Other options for outpatient treatment of CAP in adults with comorbidities include either the -lactam amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin (specifically cefpodoxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, or cefuroxime, a second-generation cephalosporin), in combination with either doxycycline or a macrolide (SOR A). Of the available choices, only amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin would provide the appropriate spectrum of antimicrobial coverage. Amoxicillin or doxycycline monotherapy would be appropriate outpatient CAP treatment for an adult without a significant medical comorbidity. Another option in such a case is a macrolide such as azithromycin if the local pneumococcal resistance rate to macrolides is known to be less than 25% (SOR B). Oral cefuroxime would be appropriate in combination with either doxycycline or azithromycin in this scenario, but it would not provide broad enough coverage as monotherapy. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim has encountered increasing pneumococcal resistance over the past several decades and therefore does not factor into current management for CAP, either alone or in combination with cephalexin, a first-generation cephalosporin that provides coverage against skin flora but not against typical CAP pathogens.
