# Question ITE-2023-184

A 32-year-old male presents to your office because of a 3-month history of severe headaches. The pain is localized to the right orbital area and is accompanied by a red, watery eye. He notes rhinorrhea and sweating on the right side of his face along with feeling restless. The headaches occur daily and usually last 30 minutes to 1 hour. They can be triggered by strong odors or consuming alcohol. The patient reports that his symptoms improved when he tried a friend’s sumatriptan (Imitrex). A neurologic examination is unremarkable. He asks about medication to prevent these bouts of pain. The first-line prophylactic medication for this condition is

## Options

**A.** lithium

**B.** topiramate (Topamax)

**C.** ubrogepant (Ubrelvy)

**D.** valproic acid

**E.** verapamil

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

While cluster headache is rare, it can be diagnosed clinically and the individual can be properly managed. It is much more common in males, with a mean age of onset of 30. Attacks are severe and unilateral, and located in the supraorbital, orbital, or temporal regions. They can occur as frequently as every other day or as often as eight times per day. The pain is severe and has accompanying autonomic symptoms, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, unilateral watery eye, eyelid edema, sweating of the forehead, and a constricted pupil. The pain may last for only 15 minutes but can last up to 3 hours. One key feature is a sense of restlessness or agitation. These bouts can be triggered by alcohol, nitrates in food, strong odors, and nitroglycerin. Abortive treatments include triptans or supplemental oxygen 100% at 12–15 L/min for 15–20 minutes. The first-line prophylaxis for cluster headache is verapamil. Lithium is also effective for prophylaxis, however it is not first line. Topiramate has been recommended, but clinical trials have shown no evidence. Ubrogepant is indicated for acute treatment for migraine. Valproic acid is ineffective for prophylaxis for cluster headache.
