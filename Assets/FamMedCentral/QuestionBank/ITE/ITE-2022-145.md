# Question ITE-2022-145

weight loss in the past month. The patient reports excessive and frequent urination, thirst, and nausea. His only medication has been metformin, but he states that he stopped taking it 6 months ago. His current weight in your office is 93 kg (205 lb), which confirms the reported weight loss. His blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, his pulse rate is 90 beats/min, and his temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). A physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. A capillary blood glucose level is 348 mg/dL, a hemoglobin A1c is 11.5%, serum ketones are negative, and a urinalysis shows 3+ glucosuria with concentrated urine but is otherwise normal. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?

## Options

**A.** Resuming oral metformin

**B.** Starting oral empagliflozin (Jardiance)

**C.** Starting subcutaneous insulin

**D.** Starting subcutaneous liraglutide (Victoza)

**E.** Hospitalization for continuous intravenous insulin

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patient presents with symptomatic hyperglycemia in a catabolic state. In such cases insulin therapy
is the most reliable way to control hyperglycemia and reverse catabolism. Oral metformin would not be
adequate to control this degree of hyperglycemia and might not be tolerated well, given that the current
symptoms include nausea and weight loss. Similarly, both empagliflozin, which increases glucosuria and
volume contraction, and liraglutide, which decreases gastric emptying and is likely to exacerbate nausea,
are likely to be poorly tolerated in this situation. While rapid and effective treatment is essential to prevent
further complications, hospitalization is not necessary since the patient has no evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of diabetic
ketoacidosis.
