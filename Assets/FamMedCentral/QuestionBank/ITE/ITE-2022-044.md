# Question ITE-2022-044

following is an effective strategy for managing a difficult patient encounter?

## Options

**A.** Avoiding any mention of the patient’s anger

**B.** Listening with empathy and a nonjudgmental attitude

**C.** Ignoring one’s own internal emotional responses

**D.** Limiting the encounter to discussion of a single problem

**E.** Using a directive approach to the patient’s care with a predetermined agenda

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Difficult patient encounters may arise from a wide variety of patient, situational, and even physician
factors. The triggering of an emotional response from the staff or the physician is the common factor that
defines a difficult encounter. Empathetic listening skills and a nonjudgmental attitude are helpful to
facilitate effective communication. Acknowledging anger and ascertaining the patient’s concerns can help
to validate the patient’s feelings and defuse the situation. Physicians should be aware of their own
emotional response in order to navigate the situation successfully. While boundaries can be helpful,
arbitrarily limiting the visit to a single problem is unlikely to meet the patient’s needs effectively. A
patient-centered approach to interviewing, rather than a directive approach, is also more likely to be
successful.
