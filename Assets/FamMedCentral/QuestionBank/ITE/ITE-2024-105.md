# Question ITE-2024-105

## Question
Which one of the following endocrine abnormalities is associated with an increased rate of 
hidradenitis suppurativa?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Diabetes mellitus
**B)** Hyperparathyroidism
**C)** Hyperthyroidism
**D)** Hypopituitarism
**E)** Hypothyroidism

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that predominantly affects the apocrine glands of the axillae and the groin. Multiple systematic reviews and meta -analyses have shown an increased association of hidradenitis suppurativ a with type 2 diabetes. Associations have also been seen with cardiovascular risk factors such as metabolic syndrome, increased BMI, and smoking. Current research has not demonstrated any association with pituitary or thyroid disorders.
