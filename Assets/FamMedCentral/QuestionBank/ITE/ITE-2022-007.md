# Question ITE-2022-007

with a laceration sustained while doing yard work. After thoroughly cleaning the wound, you decide not to suture it because of the risk of infection. The patient received Tdap during her previous pregnancy 6 years ago and you confirm in her medical records that she completed her primary immunizations as a child. Which one of the following would be most appropriate regarding tetanus prophylaxis?

## Options

**A.** No tetanus prophylaxis

**B.** Tetanus immune globulin now

**C.** Td now

**D.** Tdap now

**E.** Tdap at 38 weeks gestation

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient needs a tetanus toxoidâ€“containing vaccine for the management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of her wound. Since pregnant
people should receive a dose of Tdap between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to protect against pertussis, Tdap
is the best choice for this patient. Tetanus immune globulin would be appropriate if this patient had not
previously completed the primary series or were showing signs of clinical tetanus. Td would be an
appropriate option for tetanus prophylaxis in nonpregnant patients who have previously received Tdap.
Because this patient requires some form of tetanus prophylaxis at this time, waiting until 38 weeks to
administer Tdap is not appropriate.

vaccination. Obstet Gynecol  2017;130(3):668-669. 2) Epidemiology and prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases: Chapter
21: Tetanus. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021.
