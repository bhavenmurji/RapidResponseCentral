# Question ITE-2024-164

## Question
A 40 -year-old female presents with symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation of sour -tasting fluid 
into her throat after meals. She experiences these symptoms at least twice per week and says that they 
have been significantly affecting her quality of life. She has tried lifestyle modifications, including 
elevating the head of her bed and avoiding trigger foods, without signi ficant relief.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial management of this patient's 
condition?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An antacid as needed
**B)** An H 2-receptor antagonist as needed
**C)** A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as needed
**D)** A PPI daily for 4–8 weeks
**E)** Esophageal pH monitoring

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient's symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation that occur at least twice per week and significantly affect her quality of life are suggestive of GERD. The most appropriate initial management for this patient would be a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) daily for 4 –8 weeks. PPIs are more effective than antacids and H ₂-receptor antagonists in providing sustained symptomatic relief and resolution of esophagitis. Antacids provide short -term relief of symptoms by neutralizing gastric acid but do not provide sustained relief or resolve esophagitis, making them inadequate as the initial management strategy for this patient. Similarly, H ₂-receptor antagonists reduce the secretion of gastric acid but are less effective than PPIs in providing symptom relief and healing esophagitis. They are typically used as an alternative treatment or for milder cases of GERD. As -needed PPIs are not the pre ferred initial management strat egy for this patient. Esophageal pH monitoring is indicated in cases in which there is diagnostic uncertainty or when evaluating the effectiveness of acid suppression therapy in refractory GERD, but it is not necessary for the initial management of uncompl icated GERD.
