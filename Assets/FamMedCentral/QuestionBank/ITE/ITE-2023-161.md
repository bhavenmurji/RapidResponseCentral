# Question ITE-2023-161

A 37-year-old male sees you for a routine health maintenance examination. He is morbidly obese with a BMI of 42 kg/m2. In addition to his obesity diagnosis, his past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and bilateral knee osteoarthritis, which are all adequately controlled with oral medications. His father died of a myocardial infarction (MI), and the patient is worried about his risk of dying of an MI like his father, since they share a similar body habitus and comorbidities. He is concerned about his weight and has researched metabolic surgical interventions on the internet. He is overwhelmed with the options and is seeking your guidance. Given his medical conditions, which one of the following surgical options is the recommended intervention?

## Options

**A.** Adjustable gastric band

**B.** Sleeve gastrectomy

**C.** Roux-en-Y gastric bypass

**D.** Biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

In obese patients with a medical history of GERD, a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is preferred over sleeve gastrectomy (SOR A). Adjustable gastric band, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion all function by limiting the physical size of the stomach. This has a potential for exacerbating GERD symptoms, despite anticipated significant weight loss. This patient meets criteria for metabolic surgery due to a diagnosis of morbid obesity, in addition to comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
