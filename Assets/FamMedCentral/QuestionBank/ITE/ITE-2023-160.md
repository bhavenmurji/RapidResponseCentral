# Question ITE-2023-160

A 76-year-old male presents to your office for evaluation. He has a history of worsening New York Heart Association class IV heart failure and is on maximum medical therapy. He had a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placed 6 months ago. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history and started smoking one pack a day at age 15. He quit smoking 10 years ago when he was diagnosed with heart failure. He asks you to schedule lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, which he has received annually for the last 10 years. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which one of the following is an indication to discontinue screening for lung cancer in this case? 59 61 ---

## Options

**A.** Limited life expectancy

**B.** Age 76

**C.** Quitting smoking within the last 10 years

**D.** Recent cardiac procedure

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. It is estimated that 90% of cases are related to tobacco exposure. Effective lung cancer screening programs are thought to reduce lung cancer–related morbidity and mortality via early detection in persons at high risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT in adults ages 50–80 who have a 20-pack-year smoking history. Eligible individuals include those who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. In this case, this patient’s New York Heart Association class IV heart failure refractory to medical and surgical therapy limits his life expectancy and screening should be discontinued. The lack of ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery would also be an indication to discontinue lung cancer screening. A recent cardiac procedure is not an indication to discontinue screening for lung cancer.
