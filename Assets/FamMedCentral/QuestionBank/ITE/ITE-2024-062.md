# Question ITE-2024-062

## Question
A 2-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after a generalized seizure that lasted for 3 
minutes and was witnessed by his parent. An examination is significant for a temporal temperature of 
38.8 °C (101.8 °F), runny nose, and cough. He does not have any previous history of seizure. A 
neurologic examination  is benign.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate management regarding this patient’s seizure?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Reassurance and return precautions
**B)** A CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel
**C)** Oral levetiracetam (Keppra)
**D)** Rectal diazepam (Diastat)
**E)** Electroencephalography

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient had a simple febrile seizure that has ended, and antiseizure medication is not recommended. Routine laboratory examinations, imaging, and electroencephalography are not recommended in simple febrile seizures. Benzodiazepines can be used in pat ients who are actively seizing for longer than 5 minutes, but this patient’s seizure has ended.
