# Question ITE-2022-027

of frailty syndrome in geriatric patients?

## Options

**A.** Protein supplements

**B.** Vitamin D supplements

**C.** Hormonal treatment with anabolic steroids

**D.** Aerobic conditioning training

**E.** Progressive resistance training

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

In geriatric patients with frailty syndrome, the intervention with the best evidence for effectiveness is
progressive resistance training as a part of a physical activity program. The routine use of protein
supplements, vitamin D supplements, or hormonal treatments, including anabolic steroids, is not
recommended. Aerobic conditioning training may be helpful but the strongest evidence for efficacy is for
activities that include progressive resistance training.
