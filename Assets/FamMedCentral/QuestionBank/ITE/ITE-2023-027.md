# Question ITE-2023-027

A 68-year-old female presents for evaluation of low back pain. Which one of the following signs or symptoms would be most consistent with a diagnosis of spinal stenosis syndrome?

## Options

**A.** Pain improvement when moving from sitting to standing

**B.** Pain improvement with lumbar extension

**C.** Pain worsened by bending forward at the waist

**D.** Poor balance

**E.** Urinary incontinence

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis is characterized by the narrowing of a neural foramen or the spinal canal, which causes impingement of the nerve roots. It is most often caused by disc protrusion/herniation or degenerative changes. Degenerative changes cause ligamentous hypertrophy and development of osteophytes that cause symptoms by impinging on spinal roots. Compression of the posterior columns of the spinal canal can impact the awareness of position sense (proprioception). A report of balance problems by patients with low back pain is 70% sensitive for spinal stenosis syndrome, and the patient may exhibit a positive Romberg test and a wide-based gait. Spinal stenosis pain is increased by movements of lumbar extension such as standing upright and improved by forward flexion such as bending over a shopping cart or while sitting. Severe impingement as in cauda equina syndrome causes urinary retention and not incontinence.
