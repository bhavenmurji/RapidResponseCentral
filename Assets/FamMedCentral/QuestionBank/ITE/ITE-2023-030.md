# Question ITE-2023-030

A 47-year-old female sees you for routine follow-up. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, and osteoarthritis. She tells you that she has noticed her ankles swelling over the past few months. In addition to a physical examination and other indicated evaluations, you also review her medications, which include the following: Acetaminophen Amlodipine (Norvasc) Atorvastatin (Lipitor) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Lisinopril (Zestril) Which one of her medications is most likely to cause edema? 11 13 ---

## Options

**A.** Acetaminophen

**B.** Amlodipine

**C.** Atorvastatin

**D.** Escitalopram

**E.** Lisinopril

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Edema is a common clinical condition in the primary care setting and may indicate numerous pathologies. Medications, including many antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory medications, hormones, gabapentinoids, and chemotherapy, can be a contributing factor and should be reviewed in the evaluation and management of edema. Of the agents in this patientâ€™s medication regimen, amlodipine is the most likely to cause or contribute to her edema. Acetaminophen, atorvastatin, escitalopram, and lisinopril are not likely the cause of her edema.
