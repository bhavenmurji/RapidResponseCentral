# Question ITE-2022-131

examination you note a nodule on the palmar aspect of the metacarpophalangeal joint with the finger flexed. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Calcific peritendinitis

**B.** Dupuytren contracture

**C.** Flexor tenosynovitis

**D.** Rheumatoid arthritis

**E.** Trigger finger

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Trigger finger, which can be associated with diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) mellitus, presents with locking, clicking, or popping
at the base of the finger or thumb. The finger may lock when flexed. Treatment consists of corticosteroid
injection or splinting, and surgery may be necessary. Calcific peritendinitis causes pain, tenderness, and
edema. Dupuytren contracture is manifested as a palpable cord in the palm and is not associated with
locking. Flexor tenosynovitis causes fusiform digit swelling and is associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis involves multiple joints.
