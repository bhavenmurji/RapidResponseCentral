# Question ITE-2024-043

## Question
You see an expectant mother for a prenatal visit. She has heard of sudden infant death syndrome and 
asks for advice on sleeping arrangements.  
 
You tell her that infants should sleep

## Answer Choices
**A)** in a crib and on their backs in the parents’ room
**B)** in a crib and on their stomachs in the parents’ room
**C)** in a crib and on their backs in their own room
**D)** in the parents’ bed and on their backs
**E)** in the parents’ bed and on their stomachs

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
The infant mortality rate from accidental suffocation and strangling in bed has increased in recent decades and some of this increase may be due to sudden infant death syndrome. Physicians should counsel expectant parents that it is safest for infants to sleep on their backs in their own cribs on a mattress with a fitted sheet. An infant should sleep in the caregiver’s room until 6 –12 months of age. Infant suffocation is more common with soft linen when sleeping in the caregiver’s bed.
