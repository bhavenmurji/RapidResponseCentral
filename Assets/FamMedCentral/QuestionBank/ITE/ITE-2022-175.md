# Question ITE-2022-175

contraception?

## Options

**A.** Delaying initiation until the patientâ€™s next menstrual period to avoid incidental use in

**B.** Limiting prescription refills to 3 months at a time

**C.** Obtaining a thorough medical history to screen for contraindications

**D.** Requiring in-person visits rather than telehealth visits for contraceptive counseling due

**E.** Requiring patients to have an up-to-date Papanicolaou test and sexually transmitted

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

There are many patient-related historical factors that may affect the safety and choice of hormonal
contraception, but very few physical factors are likely to be found on examination that would not otherwise
have been identified. Obtaining a thorough medical history is standard practice, but the Choosing Wisely
campaign recommends against requiring a pelvic or other physical examination prior to prescribing oral
contraceptives. It is unnecessary to wait to begin hormonal contraception until after the next menses, as
inadvertent exposure to oral contraception will not harm an early pregnancy. Prescribing a 1-year supply
of hormonal contraceptives improves adherence and lowers cost. There is broad consensus that sexually
transmitted infection screening and Papanicolaou testing should not be required to prescribe contraception.
