# Question ITE-2022-025

a biologic agent such as omalizumab (Xolair). A CBC reveals mild eosinophilia, indicating type 2 inflammatory asthma. In which one of the following patient scenarios should biologic treatment for asthma be considered?

## Options

**A.** Any patient with poorly controlled, severe asthma

**B.** A patient with severe non–type 2 asthma that is poorly controlled despite adherence to

**C.** A patient with type 2 inflammatory asthma that is poorly controlled despite therapy with

**D.** A patient with severe type 2 inflammatory asthma that is poorly controlled despite

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Biologic therapy for asthma targets type 2 inflammation pathways. According to the 2019 Global Initiative
for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, diagnosis and management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of severe asthma includes determination of the
asthma phenotype to assess for type 2 inflammation. Type 2 asthma includes allergic and eosinophilic
asthma. Non–type 2 asthma is driven by neutrophils and is associated with smoking and obesity. Type 2
inflammation is diagnosed by elevated eosinophils in the blood or sputum, elevated fractional exhaled nitric
oxide, or a need for oral corticosteroid maintenance therapy. Biologic therapy may be considered in
patients with severe type 2 inflammatory asthma who continue to have significant symptoms despite
adherence to optimal therapy, including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting -agonist.
