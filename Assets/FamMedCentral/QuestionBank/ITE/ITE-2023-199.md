# Question ITE-2023-199

A 66-year-old male with a current history of tobacco use, hypertension, and gout presents for an annual health maintenance examination. He does not have any concerns today. A physical examination is unremarkable except for an elevated blood pressure of 149/90 mm Hg and a bruit heard over his abdomen. Abdominal duplex ultrasonography shows an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a diameter of 4.5 cm. In addition to encouraging smoking cessation, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step? 72 74 ---

## Options

**A.** No further surveillance

**B.** Repeating abdominal duplex ultrasonography in 6–12 months

**C.** Repeating abdominal duplex ultrasonography in 2 years

**D.** Referral to a vascular surgeon for elective surgical repair

**E.** Referral to a vascular surgeon for emergent surgical repair

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends a one-time ultrasonography screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) for men ages 65–75 who have ever smoked. The major risk factors for AAA include male sex, age 65 and older, and tobacco use. Smoking history is responsible for about 75% of cases, and smoking cessation should be recommended in all patients diagnosed with AAA. An aneurysm diameter of 2.5–3.0 cm requires no surveillance, while a 6- to 12-month surveillance is required for a diameter of 4.0–5.0 cm. In males, elective surgical repair may be considered in patients with an aneurysm of 5.0–5.4 cm. However, surgical repair is required in men for asymptomatic aneurysms 5.5 cm and for rapidly expanding aneurysms. In women, surgical repair is indicated when the aneurysm is 5.0 cm.
