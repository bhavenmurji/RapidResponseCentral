# Question ITE-2024-070

## Question
A hemoglobin level ≤8 g/dL would be an appropriate RBC transfusion threshold for which one of the 
following hospitalized patients?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A 19 -year-old with symptomatic sickle cell pain crisis
**B)** A 63 -year-old who is hemodynamically stable after a major trauma
**C)** A 79 -year-old with inoperable femur and hip fractures
**D)** An 81-year-old who underwent cardiac bypass surgery 3 days ago
**E)** An 85 -year-old with diverticulosis and chronic anemia

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
The transfusion of blood products, specifically RBCs, is a common medical procedure. The transfusion threshold of RBCs for most adults is a hemoglobin level ≤7 –8 g/dL (SOR A). However, a slightly less restrictive transfusion threshold of a hemoglobin level ≤8 g/dL should be used for patients who have preexisting cardiovascular disease or are undergoing orthopedic or cardiac surgery, such as a patient who underwent cardiac bypass surgery 3 days ago (SOR C). Patients with sickle cell disease should not receive transfusions for chronic anemia or uncomplicated pain crisis without an appropriate clinical indication, and not to a higher threshold than regular adults (SOR C). A restrictive transfusion threshold of a hemoglobin level ≤7 g/dL should be used for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including those who are critically ill (SOR C).
