# Question ITE-2022-198

medical history is significant for controlled major depressive disorder. Upon admission, she requires respiratory support with oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula. You ask her wishes regarding emergency measures and she states that she does not wish to be resuscitated or intubated. She reports that she watched her mother die a “horrible death” from COVID-19 about 6 months earlier and does not want to put herself through that. She does not have an advance directive and her only living relative is her father who is cognitively impaired. You are hesitant to write the DNR/DNI order given her good health and high likelihood of survival if she were to clinically decline. Which one of the following would be most appropriate prior to writing a DNR/DNI order for this patient?

## Options

**A.** No further actions prior to writing the order

**B.** Administering a Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) and writing the order if her

**C.** Asking a second attending physician to verify her wishes

**D.** Consulting a psychiatrist for a formal assessment of mental capacity

**E.** Consulting the hospital ethics board

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Individuals are assumed to have the mental capacity to make their own medical decisions unless there are
reasons to question a patient’s capacity, such as risk factors for impaired decision-making or abrupt
changes in mental status. It is the responsibility of the care (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) team to honor the reasonable wishes of each
patient, including decisions regarding end-of-life care. DNR/DNI orders can be fluid and changed
throughout a hospital stay as more information becomes available. Patients should be provided with the
tools needed to make medical decisions and ensure that they have insight into the consequences of the
decisions. A DNR/DNI order should be written at this patient’s request without administering a depression
screen or consulting other professionals.
