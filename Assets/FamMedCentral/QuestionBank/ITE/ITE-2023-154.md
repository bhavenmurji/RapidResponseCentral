# Question ITE-2023-154

A 36-year-old male presents to the urgent care clinic 2 days after he fell on his outstretched arm while snow skiing. He waited until his return home to seek evaluation and treatment. On presentation to your clinic he reports pain located in the deltoid region that is exacerbated when lifting the arms overhead. The pain is so severe that it awakens him at night. Examination of the shoulder demonstrates weakness with external rotation, internal rotation, and abduction. The empty can and drop arm tests are positive. Initial shoulder radiographs are negative. Based on the presentation and examination, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management? 57 59 ---

## Options

**A.** Rest, ice, compression, elevation, and home exercises

**B.** NSAIDs and physical therapy

**C.** Corticosteroid injection

**D.** MRI

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Weakness and pain are common symptoms of rotator cuff tears. The empty can test has a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 81% for supraspinatus muscle tear. The drop arm test has a low sensitivity of 21% for supraspinatus muscle tear, but a very high specificity of 96%. MRI would allow evaluation of the size and degree of tear as the next step in evaluation. In large or full thickness rotator cuff tears, immediate surgical repair is recommended in otherwise young, healthy individuals. Delayed repair of such tears can result in tendon degeneration, retraction, and compromised surgical results. Surgical repair should be performed within 6 weeks of the injury. Rest, ice, compression, elevation, and home exercises; NSAIDs and physical therapy; and corticosteroid injection would not be the most appropriate options for the next step in the management of this patient’s injury.
