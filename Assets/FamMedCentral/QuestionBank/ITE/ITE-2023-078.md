# Question ITE-2023-078

A 54-year-old male with cervical disc disease, generalized anxiety disorder, and opioid use disorder on maintenance therapy presents with a 5-day history of pain and numbness in both hands and feet. He mentions that he had a COVID-19 booster vaccination 6 weeks ago. On the review of systems, he reports increased urinary frequency and feeling less steady on his feet. A neurologic examination is notable for a slightly wide-based gait, decreased sensation in the upper extremities to the forearms and lower extremities to the calves, and brisk Achilles reflexes with clonus. His muscle strength is normal in both the upper and lower extremities, and there is no spinal tenderness. The remainder of the examination, including vital signs, is normal. Which one of the following diagnoses is most consistent with this presentation? 29 31 ---

## Options

**A.** Cervical myelopathy

**B.** Epidural abscess

**C.** Guillain-Barré syndrome

**D.** Multiple sclerosis

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with findings suggestive of cord compression causing degenerative cervical myelopathy. Cord compression in the cervical spine typically causes ascending loss of sensation in all four extremities, hyperreflexia, and gait instability, and it can progress to cause extremity weakness and bladder and bowel dysfunction. Patients with active intravenous drug use are at risk for epidural abscess, but this would typically cause localized tenderness and signs of systemic inflammation, including fever. Guillain-Barré syndrome is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that can cause ascending numbness and weakness, but is associated with loss of reflexes. Neurologic deficits associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) are variable and MS is in the differential in this case, though the history and presentation are much more consistent with degenerative myelopathy.
