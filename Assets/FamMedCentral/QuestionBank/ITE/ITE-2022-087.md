# Question ITE-2022-087

Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are resulting in multiple climate changes that can adversely affect the health of patients. Which one of the following examples describes a direct effect of climate change?

## Options

**A.** Weather-related disasters have lessened, leading to an improvement in overall mental health

**B.** Shorter and warmer winters allow insect vectors to spread into new areas, increasing the rate of multiple infectious diseases

**C.** Increasing global temperatures have decreased the production of highly allergenic pollens such as ragweed

**D.** Increasing consumption of plant-based foods has resulted in increased air pollution, further exacerbating many cardiopulmonary conditions

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Climate change is responsible for multiple negative impacts on patient health, including furthering the spread of multiple infectious diseases, a decline in mental health due to weather-related natural disasters, an increased risk of allergies, and increased exacerbation of cardiopulmonary conditions. Following a plant-based diet, transitioning to more active modes of transportation, and working within the health care system to help decrease greenhouse emissions can positively impact climate change.
