# Question ITE-2024-187

## Question
A 65 -year-old female with no chronic medical problems presents for an annual Medicare wellness visit. 
You initiate a discussion regarding cervical cancer screening.  
 
According to current clinical guidelines, which one of the following would be an indication for 
additional cervical cancer screening in  this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A family history of cervical cancer in a first -degree relative
**B)** Loop excision of a high -grade precancerous lesion 15 years ago, with consecutive normal results since then
**C)** Three consecutive normal cytology results within the past 10 years, most recently 3 years ago
**D)** Two consecutive normal cytology results with negative high -risk HPV co -testing within the past 10 years, most recently 4 years ago
**E)** Unprotected intercourse with a new sex partner

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against cervical cancer screening for women >65 years of age with normal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, who have had adequate prior screening, and who otherwise are not at increased risk for cervical cancer (D recommendation). The most recent definition of “adequate prior screening” given by the American Cancer Society (ACS) is 3 consecutive negative cytology results, 2 consecutive negative co -testing results, or 2 consecutive negative high-risk HPV te sts in the 10 years prior to discontinuation of screening, with the most recent test having occurred within the relevant recommended testing interval. The recommended interval is every 3 years for cytology, and 5 years for both high -risk HPV and co -testing . Importantly, USPSTF guidelines do not apply to individuals who are at increased risk for cervical cancer, including women with a history of high -grade precancerous cervical lesions or cervical cancer. The ACS and the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines recommend continuation of cervical cancer screening for women with a history of a high -grade precancerous lesion (defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] grade 2 or higher) for a minimum of 25 years beyond the treatment of the lesion, even if this extends beyond 65 years of age. Thus, if this patient had a history of treatment for a high -grade lesion 15 years ago, this would warrant continued screening for an additional 10 years. The presence of a new sex partner should not impact the decision to discontinue screening for women who otherwise are eligible for cessation of screening. In fact, ACS recommendations apply to all asymptomatic people with a cervix, without regard to their sexual history. In contrast to several other common cancer types, cervical cancer risk is not associated with a familial/genetic inheritance pattern; therefore, a family history of cervical cancer, even in a first -degree relative
