# Question ITE-2023-067

A local corticosteroid injection is most likely to result in sustained improvement when offered early in the course of which one of the following conditions? 24 26 ---

## Options

**A.** Adhesive capsulitis

**B.** De Quervain tenosynovitis

**C.** Lateral epicondylitis

**D.** Osteoarthritis of the knee

**E.** Subacromial impingement syndrome

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal conditions are frequently effective for temporary pain relief, but these injections do not always modify the overall course of the underlying condition. In the case of de Quervain tenosynovitis, such an injection is frequently curative. In adhesive capsulitis, lateral epicondylitis, osteoarthritis of the knee, and subacromial impingement syndrome, only temporary pain relief is expected, and other treatments, such as physical therapy, are usually required for longer-term symptomatic and functional improvement.
