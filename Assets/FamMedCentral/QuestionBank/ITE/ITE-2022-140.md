# Question ITE-2022-140

examination. A review of symptoms is negative. He notes that his father died in his fifties of heart disease, but the patient does not know any further details. An examination is notable for a systolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. Which one of the following additional findings in this patient would be most consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

## Options

**A.** Decreased intensity of the murmur when supine

**B.** Decreased intensity of the murmur with the Valsalva maneuver

**C.** Elevated jugular venous distention

**D.** Elevated pulse pressure

**E.** A differential in blood pressure between the arms

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), formerly known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, is
a common and underdiagnosed form of inherited heart disease with a prevalence of 1:500 in the United
States and worldwide. HCM is associated with a systolic murmur at the lower left sternal border with an
intensity that changes along with changes to preload of the heart. Lying down increases preload, which
decreases the murmur. The Valsalva maneuver decreases preload and increases the murmur. Advanced
HCM may cause heart failure and jugular venous distention, but at that stage symptoms would be expected.
Elevated pulse pressures are classically seen with aortic insufficiency rather than HCM. Differential blood
pressures in the arms would not be expected with HCM.
