# Question ITE-2023-001

A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a 1-week history of facial swelling and progressive dyspnea with exertion. She was diagnosed 1 week ago with non-Hodgkin lymphoma but her medical history is otherwise unremarkable. A chest radiograph is shown below. After hospital admission, which one of the following would be the most appropriate urgent next step in the management of this condition?

## Options

**A.** Intravenous antibiotics

**B.** Echocardiography

**C.** Plasmapheresis

**D.** Bronchoscopy

**E.** Radiation

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Because of the prevalence of cancer in the United States, it is important for family physicians to recognize oncologic emergencies. This patient presents with signs and symptoms related to superior vena cava syndrome, which is caused by compression of the superior vena cava. This is most often caused by lung cancer or lymphoma, but it can also be related to indwelling catheters, lymph nodes, or metastatic tumors. After ensuring that the patient is hospitalized and stable, the initial treatment options include intravenous corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation, and occasionally intravascular stenting. This condition is not the result of an infection, so antibiotics would not be appropriate. Hyperviscosity syndrome is another oncologic emergency associated with leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia. It is treated with chemotherapy and plasmapheresis. Echocardiography and bronchoscopy are not indicated in the initial management of superior vena cava syndrome.
