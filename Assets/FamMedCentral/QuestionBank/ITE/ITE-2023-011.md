# Question ITE-2023-011

You are co-managing a 59-year-old female with stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism resulting in osteoporosis. Due to transportation issues, she has been unable to see her specialist and requests that you take over her laboratory surveillance for CKD–bone mineral disorder. In addition to serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and creatinine levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate, which one of the following laboratory values should be routinely monitored?

## Options

**A.** Calcitonin

**B.** Magnesium

**C.** Parathyroid hormone–related peptide

**D.** Phosphorus

**E.** TSH

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Routine laboratory monitoring is required for patients with chronic kidney disease–bone mineral disorder (CKD-BMD) or secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal disease. This patient has secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, which interferes with normal calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D regulation. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone resorption and increases serum calcium and phosphorus levels, and an elevated PTH level can result in significant hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Controlling these levels through diet and medication reduces fracture risk and mortality. Monitoring calcitonin, magnesium, and TSH levels on a routine basis is not useful for the management of CKD-BMD. PTH-related peptide is useful in diagnosing humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy but does not play a role in CKD-BMD monitoring.
