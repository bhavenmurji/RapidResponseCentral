# Question ITE-2023-009

An 82-year-old female in your palliative care service who has stage 4 breast cancer is experiencing frequent episodes of delirium. Her pain is well controlled on long-acting oral opioid therapy. Additionally, no other reversible causes of delirium are noted. Her delirium is not responding to conservative measures, and her family asks if there are any medications that can effectively manage her symptoms. Which one of the following should you recommend?

## Options

**A.** Alprazolam (Xanax)

**B.** Diazepam (Valium)

**C.** Melatonin

**D.** Risperidone (Risperdal)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The first step in managing delirium in end-of-life care is to assess for any reversible or treatable causes, including uncontrolled pain, constipation, urinary retention, infections (e.g., urinary tract infections), and medication side effects. Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol and risperidone, are recommended if conservative measures fail to control the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines should be used with caution as they can worsen delirium, especially in older patients. Melatonin is not indicated in the management of delirium.
