# Question ITE-2023-018

An unhoused 63-year-old male is brought to the emergency department in a state of agitation and confusion. He is found to be hypothermic with a body temperature of 31.1°C (88.0°F). He has a blood pressure of 90/70 mm Hg and a heart rate of 120 beats/min. While undergoing warming, which one of the following should be given to this patient?

## Options

**A.** Normal saline at room temperature

**B.** Normal saline that has been warmed

**C.** Lactated Ringer solution at room temperature

**D.** Lactated Ringer solution that has been warmed

**E.** 50% dextrose in water at room temperature

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

When fluid resuscitation is necessary in hypothermia, normal saline is preferred because hypothermic patients cannot metabolize lactate. The fluid should be warmed to 38°C–42°C (100.4°F–107.6°F.) Lactated Ringer solution and 50% dextrose in water would not be appropriate.
