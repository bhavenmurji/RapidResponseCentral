# Question ITE-2022-123

starting a statin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In which one of the following patients would a screening coronary artery calcium score be most appropriate for guiding this recommendation?

## Options

**A.** A 35-year-old at low (<5%) 10-year risk

**B.** A 55-year-old at high ( 20%) 10-year risk

**C.** A 55-year-old with diabetes mellitus at high ( 20%) 10-year risk

**D.** A 60-year-old at low (<5%) 10-year risk

**E.** A 60-year-old at intermediate (7.5% to <20%) 10-year risk

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

For primary preventive interventions for the management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of lipids, the 10-year atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease risk estimate is useful as a starting point for shared decision-making with patients.
Specifically, it is a helpful tool when deciding on the use and intensity of statin therapy. The coronary
artery calcium score can refine the risk assessment even further for those at intermediate predicted risk
(7.5% to <20%) or borderline predicted risk (5% to <7.5%).

For those at intermediate or borderline risk with a coronary artery calcium score of 0, it would not be
reasonable to start a statin. If the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or greater, starting a statin is
acceptable in patients 55 years of age.
