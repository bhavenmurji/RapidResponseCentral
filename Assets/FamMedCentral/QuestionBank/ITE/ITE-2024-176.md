# Question ITE-2024-176

## Question
Which one of the following conditions is most associated with an increased risk for venous 
thromboembolism?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Active cancer
**B)** COPD
**C)** Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes
**D)** Severe intermittent asthma
**E)** Stage 3 chronic kidney disease

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) should receive anticoagulant therapy for at least 3 months to reduce the risk for further embolization. In patients with persistent provoking factors such as active cancer or antiphospholipid syndrome, or who have had previous episodes of unprovoked VTE, the long -term risk for recurrence is high and indefinite anticoagulation therapy is recommended. The risk for VTE is much higher with active cancer compared to COPD, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, severe interm ittent asthma, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
