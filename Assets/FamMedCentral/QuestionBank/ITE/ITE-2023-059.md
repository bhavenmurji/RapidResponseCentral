# Question ITE-2023-059

You are concerned about the alcohol use of a 45-year-old family physician colleague in your community. One evening you smell alcohol on their breath when they are on-call making evening rounds at the hospital. When you try to talk with them about it, they deny having a problem and tell you to mind your own business. Which one of the following should be your next course of action?

## Options

**A.** Do nothing further

**B.** Report your concern to your state medical board

**C.** Report your concern to the American Academy of Family Physicians

**D.** Report your concern to the American Board of Family Medicine

**E.** Report your concern to the American Medical Association

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

There is an ethical and, in most states, legal obligation to report this physician for the safety of their patients. The state medical board is the appropriate agency to contact with such a concern. They will investigate the report and have the authority to intervene. The American Academy of Family Physicians and American Board of Family Medicine are not involved with licensing or intervention in the event of physician impairment.
