# Question ITE-2024-186

## Question
You are the attending physician at a nursing home and the charge nurse notifies you that 3 
symptomatic patients in 1 unit have tested positive for influenza A. The facility is implementing 
enhanced contact and droplet precautions.  
 
To prevent additional cases, you should recommend chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 
for

## Answer Choices
**A)** no residents or staff
**B)** only residents of the affected unit who have not received influenza vaccine
**C)** only residents of the affected unit
**D)** only residents of the facility who have not received influenza vaccine
**E)** all residents of the facility

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
In its 2018 clinical practice guideline, the Infectious Diseases Society of America summarized its recommendations on the diagnosis and management of seasonal influenza, including institutional outbreak management. These recommendations include active surv eillance for additional cases any time a resident of a long -term care facility is diagnosed with laboratory -confirmed influenza. Influenza can spread rapidly in the long -term care setting and outbreak control measures should be implemented immediately. The risk for severe disease and complications from influenza are high in frail older adults, and those with cognitive impairment may be less able to describe their symptoms, making case -finding more difficult. When a resident develops any respiratory symptoms during an influenza outbreak, empiric antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible without waiting for diagnostic testing results. Residents who have been exposed to those with influenza should receive chemoprophylaxis as soon as possible, regardless of their vaccination status. It is not necessary to initiate chemoprophylaxis for residents who are located on remote units.
