# Question ITE-2024-087

## Question
A 35 -year-old male presents to the urgent care clinic this morning after he became lost while hiking 
and was trapped outdoors overnight. He stayed in freezing temperatures with no preparation and was 
wearing light daytime clothing. He reports a sensation of pins and needles and very sensitive skin in 
his left index and middle fingers. On examination his vital sig ns are normal, including a core 
temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F). His skin is normal except for his left index and middle fingers, which appear pale.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Slow rewarming by remaining indoors at room temperature
**B)** Rapid rewarming using body heat by placing the hand in the axilla
**C)** Rapid rewarming in front of a dry heat source
**D)** Rapid rewarming in a warm water bath
**E)** Rapid rewarming using small chemical heating pads

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient has signs and a history of exposure indicative of frostbite. Treatment of frostbite requires thorough evaluation of the patient and treatment of hypothermia, if present. It is important to wait to rewarm until the chance of refreezing is low. Rapid rewarming should be performed in a water bath at 98.6 –102.2 °F (37.0 –39.0 °C). The affected extremity should be swirled in the water, avoiding the bath edge, until the skin appears red or purple and is soft to the touch. Slow rewarming is not recomme nded for frostbite. Using body heat by placing the hand in the axilla is not a method of rapid rewarming, although it can be used for spontaneous thawing if rapid rewarming is not possible. Dry heat should not be used due to difficulty maintaining a stable temperature. Small chemical heating pads that are often used for hands should be avoided as they can cause burns. The degree of injury related to frostbite cannot be determined until after rewarming, which will determine further steps in treatment.
