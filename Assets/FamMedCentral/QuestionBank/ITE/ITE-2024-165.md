# Question ITE-2024-165

## Question
Which one of the following is true regarding bariatric surgery?

## Answer Choices
**A)** It has no effect on obesity -related mortality
**B)** It results in weight loss equivalent to that seen with intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions
**C)** It is effective for treating diabetes mellitus
**D)** Laparoscopic sleeve banding leads to the greatest weight loss

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Bariatric surgery is highly effective in treating obesity -related comorbidities, particularly diabetes mellitus (SOR A). It also reduces obesity -related mortality (SOR B) and results in greater weight loss than nonsurgical weight loss interventions (SOR A) . Among the 3 major bariatric surgery procedures, Roux -en-Y gastric bypass leads to the greatest weight loss over the first 2 years. Referenc e Schroeder R, Harrison TD, McGraw SL.
