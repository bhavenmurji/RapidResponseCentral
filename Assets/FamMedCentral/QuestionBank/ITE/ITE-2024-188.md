# Question ITE-2024-188

## Question
A 67-year-old male presents for an annual health maintenance visit. His medical conditions include 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and osteoarthritis. He is under the care of a 
cardiologist and is scheduled for an annual echocardiogram ne xt week. He reports that he generally 
feels well but “can’t keep up with the grandkids” anymore. He has not had any lightheadedness, chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or lower extremity edema.  
 
Which one of the following findings would support surgical trea tment for aortic stenosis at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An elevated 10 -year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk
**B)** A left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% –45%
**C)** A need for an elective total knee replacement
**D)** A normal exercise stress test result

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Aortic stenosis (AS) occurs primarily in older adults and is a result of narrowing of the aortic valve area due to damage from the aging process that involves lipid accumulation, calcification, and inflammation. While survival rates in patients with asympt omatic AS match those without AS, survival rates drop dramatically once symptoms develop. Because there is no effective medical management for preventing the progression of AS, recognizing indications for aortic valve replacement (AVR) results in improved survival and symptoms. Any symptomatic patient with severe AS (maximum transaortic velocity ≥4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥40 mm Hg) should undergo AVR. It is difficult to determine whether this patient is truly symptomatic from AS, but a left ventric ular ejection fraction <50% would support a need for AVR in this patient. An abnormal exercise stress test, rather than a normal test, would also indicate a need for AVR. Finally, a need for other cardiac surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting, w ould also prompt AVR. An elevated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk should prompt consideration of statin and aspirin prophylaxis but does not play a role in deciding when to perform AVR. A need for a noncardiac, elective surgical intervention wo uld not lead to a recommendation for AVR due to the high-risk nature of AVR.
