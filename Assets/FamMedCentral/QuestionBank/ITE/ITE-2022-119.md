# Question ITE-2022-119

that is relieved with rest. An ankle-brachial index is 0.7. All of the following would be appropriate for this patient EXCEPT

## Options

**A.** apixaban (Eliquis), 5 mg twice daily

**B.** enteric-coated aspirin, 81 mg daily

**C.** rosuvastatin (Crestor), 10 mg daily

**D.** a structured exercise program

**E.** tobacco cessation

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has confirmed peripheral artery disease (PAD) with an abnormal ankle-brachial index (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-index.md|2023 05 Index]]).
Guideline-directed therapy for PAD includes low-dose aspirin, moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy,
an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a structured exercise program, and smoking cessation.
Apixaban is a novel oral anticoagulant that is used for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
as well as treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Apixaban is not used for the
treatment of PAD.
