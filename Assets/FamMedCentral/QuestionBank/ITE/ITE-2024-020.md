# Question ITE-2024-020

## Question
An otherwise healthy 12 -year-old is brought to your office by a parent because the child has had an 
itchy scalp for the last 2 months. The patient has tried multiple dandruff shampoos and is now using 
tea tree oil without relief. On examination you note se veral 1 - to 2-cm annular lesions on the scalp 
with small black dots and scale. There is tender lymphadenopathy of the occipital scalp.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Obtaining a scraping for culture
**B)** Initiating topical fluocinonide solution
**C)** Initiating topical ketoconazole shampoo
**D)** Initiating oral itraconazole (Sporanox)
**E)** Initiating oral terbinafine

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Pruritic annular scalp lesions with hair loss, scale, and tender lymphadenopathy should prompt a diagnosis of tinea capitis, a relatively common pediatric fungal infection with a prevalence of 0% –19% in school -aged children. The preferred therapy for tinea capitis is oral terbinafine or griseofulvin (SOR B). The shortest course is terbinafine at 2 weeks and it is effective for most causes of tinea capitis. Griseofulvin is more expensive and requires a longer course of treatmen t. Second -line therapies include fluconazole and itraconazole. Depending on the formulation, these can require 3 –12 weeks of treatment. Fungal cultures can be negative if patients have used emollients or oils in the week prior to testing, and waiting for a culture to return will delay treatment. Fluocinonide solution is a treatment for seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis but is ine ffective in tinea capitis. Treatment with topical antifungals alone is ineffective because topical treatments do not penetrate the hair shafts where the dermatophyte infection occurs. However, the use of topical antifungals in conjunction with the oral ant ifungal can speed resolution.
