# Question ITE-2023-048

A 63-year-old female with a history of obesity and hypertension sees you for evaluation of shortness of breath on exertion and lower extremity edema. Echocardiography shows grade 2 diastolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction of 50%. You diagnose heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Which one of the following medications has the best evidence to reduce hospitalization due to heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients such as this? 17 19 ---

## Options

**A.** Carvedilol (Coreg)

**B.** Empagliflozin (Jardiance)

**C.** Lisinopril (Zestril)

**D.** Sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto)

**E.** Spironolactone (Aldactone)

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), defined as an EF ï‚³50%, has a relative paucity of evidence-based treatments leading to improved patient outcomes compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), defined as an EF <40%. While all of the options listed have good evidence of benefit in HFrEF, only the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has been shown to improve the composite outcome of hospitalization due to heart failure or cardiovascular death in HFpEF. The 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guideline for the management of heart failure recommends SGLT2 inhibitors as having the best evidence of benefit in HFpEF. -Blockers such as carvedilol may be used for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HFpEF but are not clearly beneficial otherwise. Clinical trials of ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril and angiotensin receptor blockers such as valsartan have not shown improved outcomes for patients with HFpEF. Sacubitril/valsartan similarly did not achieve the primary end point of improvement in time to HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death in this patient population. The mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone is associated with improved diastolic function in patients with HFpEF and was found to improve hospitalizations but not cardiovascular death as a primary outcome.
