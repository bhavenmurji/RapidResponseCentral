# Question ITE-2023-108

A 55-year-old male presents to your clinic for evaluation of COPD. He has a history of tobacco use and quit smoking 2 years ago. He reports occasional symptoms that limit his activities but has not had any exacerbations or hospitalizations. Pulmonary function tests indicate an FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7 and an FEV1 of 75%. His vital signs are normal. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy? 41 43 ---

## Options

**A.** Budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort)

**B.** Ipratropium (Atrovent)

**C.** Levalbuterol

**D.** Tiotropium (Spiriva)

**E.** Umeclidinium/vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

COPD is a common condition, which led to 3.23 million deaths worldwide in 2019. A variety of treatments are available to alleviate symptoms, and family physicians are well suited to manage this condition through lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. Guidelines suggest that patients with mild disease, as in this patientâ€™s case per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) class 2 findings on pulmonary function tests and no exacerbations, are best managed through once-daily inhalation of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) such as tiotropium. Short-acting medications such as ipratropium and levalbuterol require frequent dosing and lack the mortality benefit seen with LAMAs. The combination of LAMAs and long-acting -agonists (LABAs) can be initiated in those with persistent symptoms but would not be used as initial therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial in those with significant asthma and COPD overlap, but in general corticosteroids should be reserved for those with persistent symptoms despite LAMA and LABA therapy. 42
