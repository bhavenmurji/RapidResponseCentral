# Question ITE-2023-188

A 37-year-old male presents for a medical clearance examination. He has no symptoms or concerns. His past medical and surgical histories are unremarkable. His social history is significant for a 20-pack-year cigarette use and occasional alcohol intake. When asked if he has considered quitting smoking, he says that he may wish to quit some day for his health, but he is not currently ready. In addition to behavioral counseling, which one of the following medications has been shown to be effective for smoking cessation in patients who are reluctant to quit? 68 70 --- 69 71 ---

## Options

**A.** Bupropion (Wellbutrin SR)

**B.** Clonidine

**C.** Nicotine transdermal patch (Nicoderm CQ)

**D.** Nortriptyline (Pamelor)

**E.** Varenicline

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Randomized, controlled studies demonstrate that varenicline is effective in smoking cessation, even when patients are not ready to quit (SOR B). According to the American Thoracic Society, varenicline is also preferred for smoking cessation compared to bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy. Other smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, such as bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, and alternative treatment with clonidine and nortriptyline, are only initiated when an individual is ready to quit.
