# Question ITE-2024-120

## Question
A fully vaccinated 4 -year-old female is brought to your office in September because of a 10 -day 
history of febrile upper respiratory illness. During that time, she tested negative for COVID -19, 
influenzas A and B, Streptococcus , and respiratory syncytial virus. She appeared to be slowly 
improving, but today she has begun to report pain in her right shoulder and thigh. This morning she 
refused to eat her breakfast and choked on her milk. She was unable to dress unassisted today.  
 On examination she is afebri
le with normal vital signs, appears tired, and is not speaking as clearly as 
usual. She has clear nasal discharge, no adenopathy, normal tympanic membranes, a supple neck, and 
clear lungs. There is no heart murmur. She can rise from her chair but cannot be ar weight on her right 
leg. Her grip strength is good bilaterally, but she cannot raise her right arm against gravity. Reflexes at the right biceps and patella are absent. Her tongue muscles appear weak on examination

## Answer Choices
**A)** Starting oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)
**B)** Starting oral prednisone
**C)** Checking IgG and IgM levels for Epstein -Barr virus and cytomegalovirus
**D)** Obtaining MRI of the right hip
**E)** Sending her to the emergency department for hospital admission

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient most likely has acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a disease first named in 2014 to describe a rapid onset of flaccid limb weakness without a known cause. Most cases follow a viral febrile illness; the disease can progress rapidly to respiratory fa ilure and dangerous autonomic instability. When AFM is suspected, patients should be immediately admitted to a hospital capable of intensive care support. Collecting samples for analysis is important but should not delay admission, nor should infectious di sease consultation. Corticosteroids may also be administered once the patient is hospitalized, although human evidence is lacking in this condition. AFM cases have increased rapidly since the condition was first recognized. The disease occurs predominantly in younger children and causes a nondemyelinating injury to the central grey matter of the spinal cord. This is best discerned via MRI and helps to differentiate this disease from acute transverse myelitis, Guillain -Barr√© syndrome, or multiple sclerosis. Deficits are frequently proximal and do not follow an ascending pattern, and they may include cranial nerves. Family physicians should be aware of this condition and prepared to respond with the urgency required.
