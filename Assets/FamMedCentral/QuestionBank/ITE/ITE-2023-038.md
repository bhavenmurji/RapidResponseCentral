# Question ITE-2023-038

Which one of the following is the most appropriate timing to initiate the use of fluoride varnish in infants and children to prevent dental caries?

## Options

**A.** At age 6 months if their primary water source is deficient in fluoride

**B.** At age 6 months and then four times yearly

**C.** At age 6 years and then four times yearly

**D.** When the first primary tooth erupts and then twice yearly

**E.** When the first permanent tooth erupts and then four times yearly

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Fluoride helps to prevent tooth decay and is an important aspect of good oral care. Family physicians can impact oral health, which directly affects overall health, by incorporating this into their routine practice. Fluoride varnish should be applied when the first primary tooth erupts. It should then be applied twice yearly in all infants and young children (SOR B). Also, if the patientâ€™s primary water source is deficient in fluoride, then fluoride supplements should be prescribed for children beginning at 6 months of age.
