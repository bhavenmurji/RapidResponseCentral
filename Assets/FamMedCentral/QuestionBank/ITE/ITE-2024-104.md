# Question ITE-2024-104

## Question
A 25 -year-old primigravida at 30 weeks’ gestation presents with a 2 -week history of intense pruritus 
of the palms and soles. The pregnancy has otherwise been uncomplicated. There are no skin lesions on examination. A CBC is unremarkable, but a metabolic panel is notable for the following:  
ALT 85 U/L (N 7 –55) 
AST 75 U/L (N 8 –48) 
Alkaline phosphatase  140 U/L (N 45 –114) 
Bilirubin  1.8 mg/dL (N 0.1 –1.2) 
Which one of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An acute hepatitis profile
**B)** A bile acid level
**C)** A gamma -glutamyl transferase level
**D)** Ultrasonography of the liver
**E)** A punch biopsy of the skin

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can occur in up to 2% of pregnancies and is most frequent in the second or third trimester. The condition causes severe pruritus initially occurring on the palms and soles without skin lesions. The pruritus may become generalized, and excoriations are often noted due to scratching. Liver enzymes may be mildly elevated and up to 10% of patients develop jaundice. A diagnosis can be made clinically and by elevated serum bile acid levels. The maternal prognosis is good, but the elevated bile acids present a risk for the fetus, and fetal surveillance should be initiated at the time of diagnosis. Due to the risk for preterm labor and fetal demise, delivery at 36 –37 weeks’ gestation is recommended. Antihistamines can be used to control pruritus, and ursodeoxycholic acid can be used to bind bile acids. Hepatitis is a reasonable consideration, but this clinical picture is more compatible with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. A serum gamma -glutamyl transferase level would test for liver inflammation but would not add any useful information. Liver ultrasonography should be performed if obstruction is suspected. A skin biopsy may reveal excoriations but would not be diagnostic.
