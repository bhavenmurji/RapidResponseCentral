# Question ITE-2022-061

has heard through friends and news articles that new guidelines seem to be discouraging people from taking a daily aspirin due to the risk of bleeding, especially severe gastrointestinal bleeding. She has no history of bleeding but has decided to stop taking her aspirin, 81 mg daily. Her blood pressure is well controlled on her current antihypertensive regimen, and she also takes a daily statin. Her medical history includes a stroke a few years ago. Which one of the following would you recommend?

## Options

**A.** No antithrombotic therapy

**B.** Resuming aspirin, 81 mg daily

**C.** Starting aspirin, 500 mg daily

**D.** Starting apixaban (Eliquis), 2.5 mg daily

**E.** Starting warfarin, with a target INR >3.0

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Most studies of aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease involved prevention of recurrent
strokes, and showed a reduction in recurrent strokes in patients taking 75–325 mg of aspirin daily. For this
patient with a history of stroke, resuming aspirin at 81 mg daily would be clearly indicated. Multiple
organizations have advised on the role of aspirin in the primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) prevention of cardiovascular disease. In
2022 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released an update recommending against the initiation of
low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults 60 years of age as there is no
net benefit. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) came to a
similar conclusion regarding primary prevention. Specifically, the ACC states that low-dose aspirin,
75–100 mg daily, should not be administered on a routine basis for the primary prevention of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults >70 years of age. There i...
