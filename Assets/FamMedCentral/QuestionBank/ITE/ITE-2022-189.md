# Question ITE-2022-189

At a follow-up visit his blood pressure remains elevated and his serum creatinine level has increased from 0.9 mg/dL to 1.8 mg/dL (N 0.7–1.3). He has no other known medical issues and has a normal BMI. Which one of the following should be ordered to confirm the most likely cause of his hypertension?

## Options

**A.** Renin and aldosterone levels

**B.** A TSH level

**C.** 24-hour urinary free cortisol

**D.** 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines and normetanephrines

**E.** CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Resistant hypertension occurs in 5%–10% of adults with hypertension. In this patient, renal artery stenosis
is suggested by the increase in creatinine of more than 50% after starting an ACE inhibitor. CT
angiography, renal artery duplex ultrasonography, and MR angiography are appropriate diagnostic tests
for renal artery stenosis. Other causes of resistant hypertension include hyperaldosteronism (diagnosed with
renin and aldosterone levels), thyroid disorders (diagnosed with TSH levels), Cushing syndrome
(diagnosed with 24-hour urinary free cortisol), and pheochromocytoma (diagnosed with 24-hour urinary
fractionated metanephrines and normetanephrines).
