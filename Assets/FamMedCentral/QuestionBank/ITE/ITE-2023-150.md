# Question ITE-2023-150

A 74-year-old patient presents to your office for medical clearance for an upcoming surgery. In addition to basic laboratory studies requested by the surgeon, you obtain an EKG (shown below). The EKG is most consistent with which one of the following?

## Options

**A.** Left bundle branch block

**B.** Right bundle branch block

**C.** Right ventricular hypertrophy

**D.** Paced rhythm

**E.** Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This image demonstrates many of the typical EKG findings of a complete right bundle branch block (RBBB). This pattern results when the normal sequence of conduction along the His-Purkinje system is altered, resulting in widening of the QRS complex and changes in the directional vectors of the R and S waves due to delayed activation of the right ventricle. The secondary R wave is indicated by the notation R' or r'. An expert task force has created a list of electrocardiographic criteria for RBBB, including a QRS duration of ï‚³120 ms; Rsr', rsR', or rSR' in leads V1 or V2; an S wave of greater duration than the R wave or >40 ms in leads I and V6 (due to terminal electrical forces being rightward and anterior); and a normal R peak time in leads V5 and V6, but >50 ms in lead V1 associated with the R' wave. A left bundle branch block (LBBB) would also have a prolonged QRS; however, the EKG would show broad monophasic R waves in leads I, V5, and V6 that are usually notched or slurred, secondary ST and T wave changes opposite in direction to the major QRS deflection, and an rS or QS complex in the right precordial leads. Right ventricular hypertrophy would show a similar right axis deviation with an rSR' in V1 but would also have a dominant R wave in V1 >7 mm and an R wave in V1 and an S wave in V5 or V6 >10.5 mm. This EKG is not consistent with a paced rhythm strip. A Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern would also have an apparent wider QRS but would be due to an initial slurring of the QRS (delta wave). The PR interval would be decreased.
