# Question ITE-2022-182

carotid ultrasonography performed by an independent organization. The patient is asymptomatic. Her family history is negative for malignancy. On physical examination you confirm the presence of a thyroid nodule. The remainder of the examination, including the lymphatic system, is negative. A TSH level is normal. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Options

**A.** Observation only

**B.** Thyroid ultrasonography

**C.** A radionucleotide thyroid uptake scan

**D.** Fine-needle aspiration only

**E.** Fine-needle aspiration with molecular testing

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The first step in the evaluation of a palpable thyroid nodule is to obtain a TSH level and perform thyroid
ultrasonography (SOR C). If the TSH level is low, a radionucleotide thyroid uptake scan is the appropriate
next step to assess for a hyperfunctioning nodule. If the TSH level is normal or high, next steps are
determined by the size and characteristics of the thyroid nodule on ultrasonography. Fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) may be indicated depending on the size and nodule characteristics. Molecular testing of FNA
specimens is useful in order to guide management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology. Before
molecular testing is performed, patients should be counseled about the potential benefits and limitations
of the test (SOR C). Observation only would not be appropriate in this scenario.
