# Question ITE-2022-136

with his 2-year-old nephew. A penlight examination reveals sensitivity to light and mild conjunctival irritation with no foreign body. Pupillary response, extraocular movements, and visual acuity are all normal. Fluorescein staining reveals a 3-mm corneal abrasion. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate management?

## Options

**A.** Patching the affected eye

**B.** Patching the unaffected eye

**C.** Prednisolone ophthalmic drops

**D.** Tetracaine ophthalmic drops

**E.** Oral naproxen

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Corneal abrasions are a common cause of acute eye pain and are often evaluated in primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) care settings.
Small (4 mm), uncomplicated abrasions typically heal within 1–2 days and usually respond to oral
analgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs. A 2013 review reported effective pain relief and earlier
return to work with use of topical NSAIDs, although a 2017 Cochrane review subsequently found that
evidence may be lacking to support their use, especially considering the higher cost when compared to oral
options.
Patching has been proven ineffective for pain relief and can delay healing, although ophthalmologists
sometimes use patching to treat large abrasions or to provide a protective barrier for patients who may have
difficulty avoiding rubbing their eyes, such as children or people with cognitive impairment. Patching of
the unaffected eye is done to treat amblyopia but is not appropriate for managing corneal abrasions.
Topical corticosteroids such as prednisolone are not appropriat...
