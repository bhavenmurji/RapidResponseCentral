# Question ITE-2023-087

A 27-year-old male took a COVID-19 rapid antigen test at home prior to coming to your office and reports that it was negative. Which one of the following pretest probability factors increases the likelihood that the test results were falsely negative? influenza

## Options

**A.** No clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection

**B.** No known exposure to a person with COVID-19 infection

**C.** Clinical signs or symptoms that are best explained by an alternative diagnosis such as

**D.** A high prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the community

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Pretest probability is the estimated likelihood of disease prior to testing. A false-negative result occurs when the test result is negative, but the person does, in fact, have the disease. False-negative test results are more common when the pretest probability is high. Factors that increase the pretest probability of COVID-19 infection include a positive exposure history, having clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection, not having an alternative diagnosis to explain the symptoms, and a higher prevalence of infection in the community. Therefore, false-negative results occur more frequently when the prevalence of infection in a community is high (i.e., ï‚³20%) and consideration should be given to verification of the results.
