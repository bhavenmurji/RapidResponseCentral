# Question ITE-2024-013

## Question
A 63 -year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, depression, fibromyalgia, and giant cell 
arteritis presents with a 3 -week history of progressive cough and shortness of breath. She has been 
taking prednisone for the last 3 months and is tapering the dosage. Her current dosage is 25 mg daily.  
 
The patient’s vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 °C (100.6 °F), an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and a respiratory rate of 28/min. On examination, her lungs are clear, and a chest 
radiograph shows bilateral perihilar interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. You recommend hospital 
admission and intravenous antibiotics. Cultures are pending.  
 
Which one of the foll owing antibiotic combinations would be the most appropriate initial treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Azithromycin (Zithromax) and ceftriaxone
**B)** Levofloxacin and metronidazole
**C)** Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin
**D)** Azithromycin, cefepime, and vancomycin
**E)** Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), previously known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, is a fungus that causes severe pneumonia in immunosuppressed individuals. It is a classic AIDS -defining illness but can also affect those on prolonged courses of corticosteroids or other forms of immunosuppression. This patient’s presentation o f notable dyspnea, hypoxia, no focal lung sounds, and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on radiography is consistent with PJP. This patient may also have community -acquired bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for PJP along with standard antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia should be initiated while additional tests are pending. An elevated s erum lactate dehydrogenase level has a correlation with PJP, although it has poor specificity, especially in those without HIV. Serum β-glucan is indicative of a fungal infection and can be supportive of a diagnosis of PJP.
