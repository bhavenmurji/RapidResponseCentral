# Question ITE-2022-031

not have constipation and has never had abdominal surgery. You suspect acute appendicitis. Which one of the following imaging modalities would be most appropriate to consider first?

## Options

**A.** Plain radiography

**B.** Ultrasonography

**C.** CT without contrast

**D.** CT with contrast

**E.** MRI

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Ultrasonography is recommended as the initial imaging modality to evaluate acute abdominal pain in
children. It avoids radiation exposure and is useful for detecting many causes of abdominal pain, including
appendicitis. After ultrasonography, CT or MRI can be used if necessary to diagnose appendicitis.
Abdominal radiography is helpful in patients with constipation, possible bowel obstruction, or a history
of previous abdominal surgery.
The American Academy of Pediatrics Choosing Wisely recommendation on the evaluation of abdominal
pain states that CT is not always necessary. Similarly, the American College of Surgeons Choosing Wisely
recommendation on the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children says that CT should be avoided
until after ultrasonography has been considered as an option.
