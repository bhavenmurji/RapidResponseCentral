# Question ITE-2023-196

A 32-year-old female presents to your office with a 6-month history of difficulty sleeping. This occurs 4–5 nights per week and often it takes her more than 2 hours to fall asleep. Which one of the following is the first-line therapy for this condition? 71 73 ---

## Options

**A.** Diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy), 25–50 mg before bed

**B.** Lorazepam (Ativan), 0.5 mg before bed

**C.** Zolpidem (Ambien), 5 mg before bed

**D.** Positive airway pressure therapy

**E.** Cognitive behavioral therapy

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient meets diagnostic criteria for insomnia. She has prolonged sleep latency (>30 minutes) for at least 3 nights per week for at least 3 months. First-line therapy for chronic insomnia is a trial of cognitive behavioral therapy; if this is not effective a trial of pharmacologic therapy may be considered. Antihistamine therapy is often used but the American Academy of Sleep Medicine notes the benefits are essentially equal to the harms and does not recommend this for insomnia treatment. Benzodiazepines have dependency issues and can also increase the risk of falls in elderly patients. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon) have shown limited effectiveness but are approved only for short-term use. Positive airway pressure is used for treatment of sleep apnea but not insomnia.
