# Question ITE-2022-035

Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening this patient for which one of the following?

## Options

**A.** Anemia

**B.** Depression

**C.** Diabetes mellitus

**D.** Dyslipidemia

**E.** HIV

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for depression in adolescents
and adults starting at age 12. The USPSTF states that the current evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) is insufficient to assess the
balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in children 6–24 months of age (I
recommendation) and does not offer recommendations regarding other age groups. There are no USPSTF
recommendations regarding universal screening for diabetes mellitus in children or adolescents. The
American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends screening for dyslipidemia in children once between
9 and 11 years of age, but the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the
balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years of age
(I recommendation). HIV screening is recommended in adolescents and adults 15–65 years of age (A
recommendation).
