# Question ITE-2022-098

current medications include levothyroxine (Synthroid), 100 μg daily, and a prenatal vitamin. She had a normal TSH level 3 months ago. She is very concerned about the negative effects of medication during pregnancy and asks if she should continue taking levothyroxine. Which one of the following would be most appropriate for this patient at this time?

## Options

**A.** Continuing the current levothyroxine dosage and referring her to an endocrinologist

**B.** Increasing the levothyroxine dosage by 30% by taking an extra dose twice weekly

**C.** Checking her TSH level today and increasing the levothyroxine dosage by 12.5 μg daily

**D.** Discontinuing levothyroxine and checking her TSH and free T4 levels in 6 weeks

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Pregnant patients with hypothyroidism require increased dosages of levothyroxine as early as the first 4
weeks of pregnancy. General recommendations advise taking an extra dose 2 days per week for a total of
9 weekly doses, which is roughly a 30% increase. The TSH level should be monitored every 4 weeks
during pregnancy, and the levothyroxine dosage should be titrated to the pregnancy-specific reference
range, which is generally lower than the normal reference range. Referral to an endocrinologist to manage
fluctuating levels should be considered. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes
including spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, preeclampsia, and placental abruption.
