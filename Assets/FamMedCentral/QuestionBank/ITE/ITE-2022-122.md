# Question ITE-2022-122

to gradually worsen during play and is relieved by rest. His other daily activities have not been affected and he has no nighttime pain. Examination of the right shoulder reveals a normal appearance, no tenderness to palpation, normal abduction strength, and a positive painful arc at 90Â°. The drop-arm rotator cuff test is negative, the Hawkins impingement sign is mildly positive, the empty-can supraspinatus test is moderately positive, and the Gerber liftoff test is negative. Radiographs of the right shoulder are normal. Which one of the following would be appropriate at this time to provide long-term pain relief?

## Options

**A.** Complete shoulder rest with temporary use of a shoulder sling

**B.** Recommending that he permanently stop playing baseball

**C.** A subacromial corticosteroid injection

**D.** Physical therapy

**E.** Referral for arthroscopic surgery

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient has shoulder impingement syndrome (with a positive Hawkins impingement sign) and evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]])
of supraspinatus tendinopathy (with a positive empty-can rotator cuff test). However, the negative
drop-arm rotator cuff test is evidence against a complete rotator cuff tear with a negative drop-arm rotator
cuff test, and the absence of night pain supports this. Physical therapy, along with pain control using
NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or short-term opiate medication, would be most appropriate as initial therapy.
Complete shoulder rest is inappropriate since his daily activities are not aggravating the problem, and
cessation of play is not necessary since other treatment options are available. A subacromial corticosteroid
injection, while commonly done and likely to provide short-term pain relief, is unlikely to provide
long-term improvement in pain and function. Surgery is a potential option if other treatments fail and a
significant tear is proven, but is not preferable as an initial t...
