# Question ITE-2024-051

## Question
A generally healthy 5 -month -old female is brought to your office by her parent for follow -up of a 
worsening, painless, red lesion on her right earlobe that has been present since birth. The parent is 
concerned because the lesion has rapidly increased in size over the last few months. A physical  
examination reveals a nontender, bluish -red, exophytic plaque on the right earlobe (shown below).   
Which one of the following would be an appropriate treatment for this condition?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Topical hydrocortisone 0.5%, twice daily
**B)** Oral propranolol hydrochloride, 2 –3 mg/kg daily
**C)** Embolization
**D)** Excisional surgery

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors in childhood, and are mostly small and self -resolving. However, patients with large lesions, lesions >2 mm above the skin, or lesions near the eyes, ears, and nose are considered to be at high risk fo r disfigurement. First-line treatment includes oral propranolol hydrochloride, 2 –3 mg/kg daily. Alternative treatments include topical timolol 0.5% gel -forming solution, twice daily, and high - potency corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate 0.05%, but not hydrocortiso ne 0.5%. Embolization and excisional surgery are reserved for select cases in which medical treatment has failed.
