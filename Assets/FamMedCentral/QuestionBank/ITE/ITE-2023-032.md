# Question ITE-2023-032

A 62-year-old male presents with daytime fatigue, sleepiness, snoring at night, and a BMI of 41 kg/m2. You are concerned that he may have obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) in addition to possible obstructive sleep apnea. Which one of the following tests is most appropriate for establishing a diagnosis of OHS?

## Options

**A.** Daytime awake serum HCO3–

**B.** Daytime awake PaCO2

**C.** Daytime awake PaO2

**D.** Nighttime serial measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation during sleep

**E.** Nighttime serum HCO3– within 2 minutes of awakening

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterized by obesity and alveolar hypoventilation while awake, which is defined by an awake PaCO2 level >45 mm Hg. Ninety percent of patients have coexistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The pathogenesis is related to the increased physical demands on breathing caused by obesity. While decreased PaO2 or oxygen saturation is often present, it is not part of the diagnostic criteria. In obese patients with lower risk (often with lower BMIs), a serum HCO3– level <27 mmol/L may obviate the need for an arterial blood gas measurement as OHS becomes very unlikely. If the HCO3– level is 27 mmol/L (a renal compensatory mechanism for hypoventilation-induced acidosis), a PaCO2 measurement should be obtained to establish the diagnosis. The first-line treatment for ambulatory patients with this condition is CPAP. Nighttime measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation during sleep is a key component of sleep studies that are used to diagnose OSA, but it is not used to diagnose OHS.
