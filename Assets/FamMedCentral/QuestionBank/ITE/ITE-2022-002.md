## Explanation

Erythema nodosum, a panniculitis that typically affects the subcutaneous fat on the anterior surface of the lower legs, is associated with coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) and can suggest the diagnosis. It is a manifestation of the patientâ€™s immune response and often indicates a good prognosis. In addition to coccidioidomycosis, it can also be associated with streptococcal infections as well as tuberculosis. Erythema ab igne is a cutaneous rash caused by prolonged heat exposure (such as a heating pad) presenting as an otherwise asymptomatic, red, reticulated pattern on the skin. Erythema infectiosum is associated with parvovirus B19 infection and is usually seen in young children. It manifests as an erythematous rash of the face (slapped cheek appearance), arms, and legs. Erythema migrans is an expanding, erythematous, annular rash with or without central clearing and is often associated with tick exposure (Lyme disease). Erythema multiforme consists of raised, annular, target-like lesions with central erythema and is usually associated with herpes simplex virus type 1.
