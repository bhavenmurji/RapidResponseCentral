# Question ITE-2023-088

A 28-year-old gravida 2 para 2 sees you for follow-up of heavy menstrual bleeding. She reports regular 30-day cycles with heavy bleeding that lasts for 5 days each month. She has tried ibuprofen and naproxen with minimal improvement. She and her husband desire more children but would prefer to wait a few years before trying again to conceive. Which one of the following treatments is likely to be most effective in reducing her menstrual bleeding, while preserving future fertility? 33 35 ---

## Options

**A.** An estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive

**B.** Tranexamic acid (Lysteda)

**C.** A levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)

**D.** Uterine artery embolization

**E.** Endometrial ablation

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Of the available treatment options, the levonorgestrel IUD is the most effective for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding (SOR A), with a 71%–95% decrease in menstrual blood loss expected. Estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives are less effective, with expected reduction in blood loss of 35%–69%, although they provide an added benefit of regulating menstrual bleeding in patients with anovulatory cycles. Nonhormonal medication options include tranexamic acid and NSAIDs, with an expected blood loss reduction of 26%–54% and 10%–52%, respectively. Two effective procedural options that are lower risk and less invasive compared to hysterectomy include uterine artery embolization and endometrial ablation, although both would present significant risk of reducing future fertility and therefore would not be the preferred treatment for this patient.
