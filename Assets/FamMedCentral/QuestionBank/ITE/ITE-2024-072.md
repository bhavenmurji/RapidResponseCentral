# Question ITE-2024-072

## Question
Lymphadenopathy in which one of the following sites in a 55 -year-old male would suggest 
malignancy?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Anterior cervical
**B)** Posterior cervical
**C)** Axillary
**D)** Inguinal
**E)** Supraclavicular

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
While lymphadenopathy is generally self -limited with a benign etiology, lymphadenopathy at the supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac locations is abnormal. Epitrochlear nodes >5 mm in diameter are also abnormal. Because it is associated with a high risk fo r intra -abdominal malignancy, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy should be evaluated immediately. This applies to both adults and children although patients >40 years of age are at highest risk. Studies indicate that 34% â€“50% of these patients with supraclavic ular lymphadenopathy have malignancy. Infection is a common cause of anterior cervical, posterior cervical, submental, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Axillary lymphadenopathy is commonly caused by infections or injuries of the upper extremities. Many healthy adults have inguinal lymphadeno pathy.
