# Question ITE-2024-059

## Question
A 16 -year-old female presents for a routine checkup. During the visit, she discloses that she is sexually 
active and wants to discuss contraceptive options. However, she is hesitant to inform her parents, fearing 
their disapproval.  
 
Which one of the following is the most ethical course of action?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Providing the patient with contraception without informing her parents, and respecting her confidentiality by not noting this discussion in her medical record
**B)** Offering confidential counseling and contraceptive options while encouraging open communication with her parents
**C)** Insisting on parental involvement in the decision -making process, emphasizing the importance of open communication
**D)** Referring the patient to a mental health professional to address her concerns about parental disapproval before discussing contraception
**E)** Refusing to discuss contraception without parental consent, citing the patient’s age

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
While respecting the patient’s autonomy and confidentiality is important, ethical obligations also extend to ensuring her well -being and safety, and accurately maintaining the medical record. Encouraging open communication with parents can foster trust and support, but forcing it might create a harmful environment. Offering counseling and contraceptive options while advocating for open communication allows the physician to foster patient autonomy as well as uphold responsible guidance. This approach aligns with ethical guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics that emphasize respect for minors’ confidentiality while considering parental involvement in sensitive situations.
