# Question ITE-2023-051

A 46-year-old female comes to your office because of left hip pain. After a thorough evaluation you make a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, likely associated with congenital hip dysplasia. In addition to nonpharmacologic therapies, including physical exercise, which one of the following medications has the best evidence of treating her pain effectively?

## Options

**A.** Topical diclofenac

**B.** Topical lidocaine

**C.** Oral acetaminophen

**D.** Oral naproxen

**E.** Oral tramadol

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is estimated to affect 10% of U.S. adults. Nonpharmacologic measures are the cornerstone of treatment and include physical activity, including strength training, aerobic exercise, tai chi, and yoga; weight loss for those who are overweight; and education in self-management. When these interventions are not adequate to manage pain, medications should be considered. In patients without contraindications, oral NSAIDs such as naproxen should be considered as first-line management. The hip joint is less amenable to topical therapies than the knee joint and topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac do not have evidence of benefit for hip osteoarthritis. Topical lidocaine is similarly without evidence of benefit at the hip joint. Those with risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicity should receive prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors when treated with oral NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is less effective than NSAIDs but may be considered for use. Tramadol should not be used as a first-line treatment for pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip.
