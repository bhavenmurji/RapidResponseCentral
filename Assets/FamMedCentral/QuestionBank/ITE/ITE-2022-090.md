# Question ITE-2022-090

a thorough history and physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies you diagnose fibromyalgia. You explain to the patient that the initial treatment recommendation with the most proven efficacy is

## Options

**A.** acupuncture

**B.** aerobic exercise

**C.** amitriptyline

**D.** duloxetine (Cymbalta)

**E.** tramadol

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Aerobic exercise, a balanced diet, good sleep hygiene, and weight reduction are appropriate strategies for
the management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of fibromyalgia, and treatment goals should be focused on improving function and quality
of life, along with managing symptoms. According to the 2017 European League Against Rheumatism,
exercise is the strongest and most critical treatment for fibromyalgia. Not only does it lessen fibromyalgia
symptoms, but it can also help with coexisting conditions including sleep disorders, depression, and
anxiety. While some studies show improvement in symptoms with acupuncture, most evidence is low to
moderate in quality. A Cochrane review found that acupuncture was superior to no treatment at all, but
not superior to sham acupuncture. Pharmacologic treatments have shown only modest benefits and are
often accompanied by adverse effects, so they are best used in conjunction with nonpharmacologic
therapies.
