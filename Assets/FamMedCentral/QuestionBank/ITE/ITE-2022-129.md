# Question ITE-2022-129

patient scores very high on the Somatic Symptom Scale–8 with “quite a bit” or “very much” back pain, chest pain, dizziness, low energy, headaches, stomach problems, and trouble sleeping. You have completed a thorough history and physical examination. In addition to referral for cognitive behavioral therapy, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in patient care?

## Options

**A.** Frequent, as-needed office visits

**B.** Frequent, regularly scheduled office visits

**C.** Infrequent, as-needed office visits

**D.** Infrequent, regularly scheduled office visits

**E.** Regularly scheduled annual examinations and as-needed office visits

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

In somatic symptom disorder, the primary feature is the patient’s concern with physical symptoms that
have manifested through psychological or emotional distress and have no other medical explanation. The
family physician should offer frequent, regularly scheduled visits for these patients.
The acronym CARE MD describes an approach to management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of somatic symptom disorder:
•Consultation with mental health professionals for cognitive behavioral therapy or
mindfulness-based therapy (SOR B)
•Assessment for other medical and psychiatric diseases
•Regular short-interval follow-up visits to stress coping rather than cure and to reduce the overuse
of health care visits such as the emergency department
•Empathy demonstrated by listening to the patient while acknowledging and legitimizing the
patient’s symptoms
•Medical-psychiatric interface emphasizing the mind-body connection
•Doing no harm by reassuring the patient while limiting diagnostic testing and referrals to
subspecialists
