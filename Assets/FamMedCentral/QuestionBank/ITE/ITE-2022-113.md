# Question ITE-2022-113

fracture has healed but she has developed burning pain in the area of the fracture, which she rates as 9 on a scale of 10. On examination you note moderate hyperalgesia in the area with some minimal localized swelling. You suspect complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is best diagnosed with which one of the following?

## Options

**A.** The patient history and physical examination

**B.** Ultrasonography

**C.** MRI

**D.** Nerve conduction testing

**E.** A technetium 99m bone scan

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) usually develops after an injury, often a fracture, to a distal
extremity, although it can present without prior injury. The diagnosis is made clinically using the history
and physical examination. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Ultrasonography or MRI may be used
to rule out other diagnoses but are not necessary for the diagnosis of CRPS. Nerve injury can be seen on
nerve conduction testing with type 2 CRPS, also known as causalgia, but nerve injury is not always
identified with type 1 CRPS, also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Nerve conduction testing is not
necessary for making the diagnosis, and both types of CRPS are treated with the same approach. A
technetium 99m bone scan may reveal increased bone resorption at the site, but it is neither sensitive nor
specific for CRPS.
