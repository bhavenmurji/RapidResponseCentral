# Question ITE-2022-168

intermittent, but now occurs as paroxysms that frequently cause him to vomit. He feels very tired after these coughing fits. He also reports rhinorrhea throughout the course of his symptoms. He has been feeling overheated but does not report documented fevers. He notes that he does not typically receive routine vaccinations. His vital signs include a temperature of saturation of 93% on room air. He has no medication allergies. A test for COVID-19 is negative. Of the following treatments, which one would be the most beneficial for this patient’s most likely condition?
