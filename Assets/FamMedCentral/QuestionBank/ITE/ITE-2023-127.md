# Question ITE-2023-127

A 30-year-old female reports that a new male sex partner told her that he has a urethral chlamydial infection. She has no symptoms, but testing with an endocervical swab confirms that she is also infected with Chlamydia . No other sexually transmitted infections are identified. She is not allergic to any medications. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment regimen for her? 47 49 ---

## Options

**A.** Oral azithromycin (Zithromax), 1 g once

**B.** Oral cefixime (Suprax), 800 mg once

**C.** Oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 7 days

**D.** Oral levofloxacin, 500 mg daily for 7 days

**E.** Intramuscular ceftriaxone, 500 mg once

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The current recommendation for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital chlamydial infections is oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 7 days. Single-dose azithromycin may be considered if compliance is a concern, but the increasing resistance to macrolides is a potential problem. Levofloxacin is another alternative, but it is more costly and side effects may be an issue. Cefixime and ceftriaxone are used to treat gonococcal infections, not Chlamydia .
