# Question ITE-2022-164

the weekend. She rates her pain as mild to moderate. She initially tried acetaminophen, 1 g every 8 hours, and when this was ineffective, she switched to ibuprofen, 600 mg every 6–8 hours without relief. She is in good health otherwise and does not take any other medications. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy to recommend next?

## Options

**A.** A combination of acetaminophen, 500 mg, and ibuprofen, 600 mg, every 8 hours

**B.** CBD oil applied to the low back up to four times daily

**C.** Diclofenac topical (Voltaren Arthritis Pain) applied to the low back every 6 hours

**D.** Hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Norco), 5/325 mg every 6 hours

**E.** Oxycodone (Roxicodone), 5 mg, every 4–6 hours

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has acute low back pain of moderate severity. If acetaminophen and NSAIDs are ineffective
when used alone, the most appropriate next step is a combination of both medications.
Acetaminophen/NSAID combinations have been shown to be more effective for acute pain than either
agent alone. CBD oil does not have a specific indication for acute pain, and low-quality studies show
mixed results. Diclofenac topical gel is an appropriate treatment option for acute, non–low back
musculoskeletal pain. This patient describes her pain as mild to moderate in severity, so other options
should be tried before prescribing opioids such as hydrocodone/acetaminophen or oxycodone.
