# Question ITE-2022-041

reports that the child is having difficulty using her albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) metered-dose inhaler for asthma exacerbations and he is not sure whether it is improving her symptoms. On demonstration in the office, the child is unable to time her breathing with inhaler actuation. Which one of the following would you recommend?

## Options

**A.** Montelukast (Singulair)

**B.** Albuterol via oral liquid

**C.** Albuterol metered-dose inhaler via a spacer device

**D.** Albuterol via nebulizer

**E.** Salmeterol inhaled (Serevent Diskus)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Young children often have difficulty coordinating inhaler use, which can reduce the effectiveness of asthma
medications. The use of spacer devices eliminates the need for coordination and increases medication
delivery to the lungs. Oral albuterol is no longer recommended. Montelukast, nebulized albuterol, and
inhaled salmeterol are not indicated as first-line treatment for asthma exacerbations.
