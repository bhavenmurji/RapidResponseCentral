# Question ITE-2022-037

patient with stage 3 chronic kidney disease and proteinuria?

## Options

**A.** A loop diuretic and a Î²-blocker

**B.** An ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker

**C.** An ACE inhibitor and a thiazide diuretic

**D.** A calcium channel blocker and a thiazide diuretic

**E.** A potassium-sparing diuretic and a thiazide diuretic

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) on a reduction in all-cause mortality, JNC 8 advises more intensive blood pressure control in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and proteinuria. This is most often achieved with combination
therapy, with either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), plus either a thiazide
diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. ACE inhibitors and ARBs both slow the progression of CKD to
end-stage renal disease and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD (SOR A). However,
combining an ACE inhibitor and an ARB actually increases the risk of end-stage renal disease, so these
drugs should not be used simultaneously.
The other combinations listed may be effective in improving blood pressure control, but in patients with
CKD and proteinuria the combination of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB with a diuretic or calcium channel
blocker is most effective for lowering morbidity and mortality.
