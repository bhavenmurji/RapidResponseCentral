# Question ITE-2022-099

walking up hills. His medical history is significant for hypertension and coronary artery disease. Four months ago he had a positive exercise stress test and underwent coronary angiography, which showed diffuse atherosclerotic disease but no lesions suitable for percutaneous intervention. His current medications include aspirin, 81 mg; atorvastatin (Lipitor), 80 mg; and metoprolol succinate (Toprol-XL), 100 mg. His vital signs include a blood pressure of 120/66 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 68 beats/min. Recent laboratory studies are significant for an LDL-cholesterol level of 58 mg/dL, a triglyceride level of 120 mg/dL, and a troponin level of The addition of which one of the following agents would decrease this patientâ€™s all-cause mortality risk?

## Options

**A.** Clopidogrel (Plavix), 75 mg daily

**B.** Colchicine (Colcrys), 0.6 mg daily

**C.** Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), 2 g twice daily

**D.** Isosorbide mononitrate, 30 mg daily

**E.** Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), 2.5 mg twice daily

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient presents with stable angina and documented coronary atherosclerosis. His slight troponin
elevation is a marker of elevated risk. The addition of low-dose rivaroxaban to aspirin has been shown to
decrease cardiac and all-cause mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and may be offered
to this patient (SOR A). Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is recommended for 1 year
after stenting but is not recommended in patients with stable angina who do not have stents. Colchicine has
been associated with decreased cardiac events in patients with CAD but may increase all-cause mortality.
Icosapent ethyl has been shown to decrease cardiac events but not mortality in patients with
hypertriglyceridemia >150 mg/dL. Isosorbide mononitrate may be indicated to improve angina symptoms
but does not improve mortality risk.
