# Question ITE-2023-074

A 53-year-old female sees you because she would like treatment for hot flashes that she finds quite bothersome. Her last menstrual period was 8 months ago. She has a history of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis and a history of depression that is treated with venlafaxine (Effexor XR). In addition to optimizing the dosage of her venlafaxine, which one of the following would be most effective for treatment of her hot flashes?

## Options

**A.** Black cohosh

**B.** Clonidine

**C.** Gabapentin (Neurontin)

**D.** Oral progesterone

**E.** Topiramate (Topamax)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes are experienced by 50%–75% of women during the menopausal transition. These are most effectively treated by systemic estrogen replacement therapy. For patients with an intact uterus, progesterone needs to be added for endometrial protection. In patients with contraindications to estrogen therapy, SSRIs and SNRIs have been shown to be 50%–65% effective and are often the next choice. Their mechanism of action remains unknown. Gabapentin has also been shown to reduce vasomotor symptoms by 40%–65%. Black cohosh and oral progesterone are not effective. Clonidine has some effect with vasomotor symptom reduction of 20%–40%. Topiramate has not been known to be effective.
