# Question ITE-2023-096

A 45-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the urgent care clinic with hematuria and left-sided intermittent flank and inguinal pain. He has mild nausea but does not have any vomiting, fever, or other urinary symptoms. His vital signs are normal. He appears uncomfortable, but a physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. A urinalysis shows RBCs but no signs of infection. Same-day noncontrast CT shows a 3.5-mm left-sided ureteral stone. This is his first kidney stone. In addition to encouraging oral hydration and pain control with NSAIDs, which one of the following would be appropriate in the management of this ureteral stone? 36 38 ---

## Options

**A.** Observation only

**B.** Oral allopurinol (Zyloprim)

**C.** Oral cephalexin

**D.** Intravenous hydration with 2 L of lactated Ringer solution

**E.** Referral for surgical stone removal

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Ureteral stones 4 mm typically pass without intervention within 40 days. This patient is hemodynamically stable without signs of infection and therefore should be managed conservatively with oral hydration and pain control. 1-Blockers such as tamsulosin can be used to aid in the passage of ureteral stones >5 mm. Allopurinol can be used to reduce stone recurrence in patients with calcium oxalate stones but does not have a role in the management of existing stones. There is no indication for antibiotics. Intravenous fluids are not indicated as the patient is not vomiting. Because this patient’s stone should pass without intervention, referral for surgical stone removal would not be appropriate.
