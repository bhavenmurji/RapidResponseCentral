# Question ITE-2022-005

surgical history and is in good health. Her dental office calls you to discuss antibiotic prophylaxis prior to a dental cleaning. Based on current guidelines, which one of the following would be most appropriate regarding antibiotic prophylaxis prior to routine dental procedures in this patient?

## Options

**A.** No prophylaxis

**B.** Prophylaxis for 6 months post knee replacement

**C.** Prophylaxis for 1 year post knee replacement

**D.** Prophylaxis for 5 years post knee replacement

**E.** Prophylaxis for the patientâ€™s lifetime

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

One of the most potentially devastating late complications of joint replacement surgery is infection of the
prosthetic joint. Because dental procedures are known to induce transient bacteremia, the use of
prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures for patients with prosthetic joints was considered
orthopedic dogma for many years. However, current evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) to support this practice is limited and
antibiotic use is known to increase cost, bacterial resistance, and the risk of adverse drug reactions. In most
cases the risks of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh the likelihood of benefit. Recent guidelines from the
American Dental Association and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommend against
the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures in patients with a history of joint
replacement, except for situations in which infectious risk is increased, such as immunocompromise or a
history of a previous joint infection.
