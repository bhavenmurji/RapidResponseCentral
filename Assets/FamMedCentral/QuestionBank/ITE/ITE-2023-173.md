# Question ITE-2023-173

A 47-year-old female presents to your office with a 3-day history of sore throat, a fever of

## Options



## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with symptoms of pharyngitis that are most likely attributed to a viral infection. However, many patients expect to receive prescriptions for antibiotics when evaluated for common respiratory infections. Use of the Modified Centor Criteria can assist with determining the likelihood of a group A streptococcal infection before prescribing antibiotics. The Modified Centor Criteria gives points for age, absence of cough, fever, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar exudates or swelling. This patient would receive 0 points because she has a cough, –1 point because she is older than 45, 1 point because she has a fever 100.4°F, 1 point because she has tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and 1 point because she has tonsillar swelling. Therefore, her total Modified Centor Criteria score is 2, and she should be additionally evaluated with a rapid antigen detection test for group A Streptococcus (GAS). Rapid streptococcal antigen tests can reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for adults at the point of care without adverse consequences (SOR A). Since this adult patient’s test is negative she does not require treatment with antibiotics, and supportive care is recommended. There is no role for repeating a rapid streptococcal antigen test due to the high specificity of these tests. A confirmatory throat culture is not required in adults due to the low incidence of GAS pharyngitis and rheumatic fever in this age group. In contrast, children and adolescents with negative rapid streptococcal antigen test results should have confirmatory throat cultures because of the high prevalence of GAS. An order for laryngoscopy is not appropriate in this patient without symptoms of epiglottis.
