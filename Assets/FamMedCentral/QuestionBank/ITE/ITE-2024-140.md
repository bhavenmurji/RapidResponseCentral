# Question ITE-2024-140

## Question
A 40 -year-old female presents to the urgent care clinic because of significant fatigue, malaise, 
nausea, and intermittent vomiting. She is also experiencing recurrent fever and abdominal pain and 
says that her symptoms started a couple of weeks ago while s he was in South America. Now her 
urine is dark and her spouse has noted a yellow tinge to her skin and the white of her eyes, prompting 
today’s acute visit. Her vital signs are normal. A physical examination is unremarkable except for hepatomegaly and jaun dice. 
 
Which one of the following test results would confirm the suspected diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Anti–hepatitis A IgG antibodies
**B)** Anti–hepatitis A IgM antibodies
**C)** Anti–hepatitis B surface antibodies
**D)** A serum creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL (N 0.6–1.1)
**E)** Elevated serum transaminase levels

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Hepatitis A is a common cause of acute hepatic inflammation and jaundice. It was the most commonly reported type of hepatitis in the United States until 2004, when a combination of widespread vaccination and food safety practices decreased its incidence. H epatitis A is caused by nonenveloped positive -strand RNA hepatitis A virus. Humans are the only natural host. Classified as a picornavirus, it is stable in many environments and is able to survive for multiple weeks on surfaces. It is transmitted through i ngestion of infected stool particles. Consumption of contaminated water and food or close interpersonal or sexual contact with a person who is infected are common causes of infection, whereas drug use and blood transfusion are less common causes of infecti on. Incubation lasts approximately 30 days, followed by infectious symptoms, including nonspecific influenza -like symptoms, malaise, fever, nausea with vomiting, and abdominal pain. The classic findings are jaundice and dark urine. Most cases of acute hepatitis A are self -limited and there is no specific treatment. Supportive and symptomatic care should be utilized and hepatotoxins should be avoided. A liver transplant may be considered if fulminant hepatic failure develops. Serologi c testing is required for the diagnosis of hepatitis A. Anti –hepatitis A IgM antibodies become detectable 5 –10 days before the onset of symptoms, peak within a month, and can persist for >6 months. However, anti –hepatitis A IgG antibodies appear during the convalescent phase and remain elevated throughout the patient's lifetime. Therefore, anti –hepatitis A IgM antibodies would confirm the diagnosis instead of anti - hepatitis A IgG antibodies. Anti−hepatitis B surface antibodies indicate immunity to hepatitis B and would not be present in acute hepatitis B infection. A serum creatinine level >2 mg/dL is a positive predictor of fulminant hepatitis and death, but it is not diagnostic of hepatitis A. Although laboratory findin
