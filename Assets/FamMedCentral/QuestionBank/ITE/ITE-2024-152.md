# Question ITE-2024-152

## Question
A 45 -year-old gravida 2 para 2 with a history of irregular menses and bilateral tubal ligation presents 
with a 2 -month history of bilateral milky nipple discharge. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. 
She does not take any medications. A physical examination reveals a small amount of milky nipple 
discharge bilaterally with no breast masses. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Laboratory testing 
reveals normal thyroid and kidney function, and a prolactin level of 95 ng/mL (N 5 –20). Pituitary 
MRI with gadolinium shows a 7 -mm enhancing mass.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient’s 
condition?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bromocriptine (Parlodel)
**B)** Cabergoline
**C)** Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol
**D)** Metoclopramide (Reglan)
**E)** Risperidone (Risperdal)

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
This patient has hyperprolactinemia due to pituitary microadenoma and guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend cabergoline as an initial treatment. Studies have found that cabergoline is more effective than bromocriptine or other dopamine agonists at decreasing prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Oral contraceptives may regulate menstrual conditions but are not recommended as first -line treatment for hyperprolactinemia. Metoclopramide and risperidone are dopamine antagonists and can be a cause of hyperprolactinemia.
