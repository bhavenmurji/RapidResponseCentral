# Question ITE-2022-070

to evaluate his episodic shortness of breath and chest tightness. He had previously been diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma and prescribed albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), which provided minimal relief. You tell him that the pulmonary function tests revealed normal expiratory findings including normal FEV1 and FVC and a flattened inspiratory flow loop. The test most likely to confirm a diagnosis for this patientâ€™s shortness of breath is

## Options

**A.** a sleep study

**B.** chest radiography

**C.** chest CT

**D.** esophagogastroduodenoscopy

**E.** nasolaryngoscopy

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient has vocal cord dysfunction, sometimes called paradoxical vocal fold motion, a condition in
which the vocal cords close during inspiration when they should be open. It is not entirely understood why
this occurs but it is associated with other conditions including asthma, GERD, and anxiety disorders. It
typically causes sudden, severe shortness of breath and often has a trigger such as exercise,
gastroesophageal reflux, inhalation of an irritant, or stress. Symptoms may include chest or throat
tightness, inspiratory stridor, and wheezing predominantly over the upper airway. In less severe situations
the voice may be impacted, and patients sometimes also describe a chronic cough that occurs separately
from more acute symptoms. Vocal cord dysfunction is confirmed by direct visualization of the vocal cords
during inspiration via nasolaryngoscopy. Pulmonary function tests are often performed as part of the
assessment for shortness of breath and, if performed while the patient is...
