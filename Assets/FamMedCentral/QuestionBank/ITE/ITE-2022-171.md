# Question ITE-2022-171

on her right leg. Yesterday the patient was playing at the park and her mother did not notice any injury occur. There has been no recent illness or fever. The child was born at full term, has had no medical problems, and is up to date on vaccinations. The patient’s vital signs are normal. A physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing child in no apparent distress. She grimaces and pulls away with palpation of the right leg over the lower tibia and she will not bear weight. She has full passive range of motion of her hip, knee, and ankle joints bilaterally without apparent pain. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of her right tibia and fibula show no abnormalities. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management?

## Options

**A.** Reassurance only

**B.** A CBC and C-reactive protein level

**C.** Immobilization with a cam boot, and repeat radiographs in 7 days

**D.** Bone scintigraphy

**E.** Referral to an orthopedic surgeon

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

A nondisplaced spiral fracture of the distal tibial shaft (toddler’s fracture) should be suspected in children
from 9 months to 3 years of age who present with pain in the distal third of the tibia after minor or even
unnoticed injury. Toddler’s fractures can have subtle radiographic findings and may not be visible on initial
radiographs, so repeat radiography to look for healing is appropriate. Standard treatment is immobilization
of the affected leg. While the fracture may heal without immobilization, reassurance alone is not
recommended given the unclear diagnosis. If repeat radiography is negative and symptoms have resolved,
reassurance may then be appropriate. For children with possible septic arthritis, laboratory studies should
be considered, but in this case there are no signs of infection. Bone scintigraphy is more sensitive than
radiography and can be considered if follow-up radiography is negative and symptoms persist. Toddler’s
fractures routinely heal without complication,...
