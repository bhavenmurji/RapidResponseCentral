# Question ITE-2023-112

A 35-year-old female with previously regular menses presents with a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased irritability. A pregnancy test is negative, an estrogen level is low, and an FSH level is markedly elevated. There is no change in repeat testing 1 month later and you make a diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency. Further testing does not reveal a cause for her condition. She does not desire more children. Which one of the following should you recommend to this patient for hormone replacement therapy?

## Options

**A.** No treatment

**B.** Transdermal estradiol without progestogen

**C.** Continuous oral estradiol without progestogen

**D.** Continuous oral estradiol and cyclic progestogen

**E.** Continuous oral estradiol and a levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency should be started on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as soon as possible after diagnosis, preferably within a year. HRT treats symptoms and benefits bone health, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function. It should be continued until the age of expected natural menopause. In a patient with a uterus, protection against endometrial cancer with progesterone is required. A significant proportion of patients with this disorder occasionally ovulate or have spontaneous return of menses. HRT does not provide contraception. A levonorgestrel IUD provides both endometrial protection and contraception.
