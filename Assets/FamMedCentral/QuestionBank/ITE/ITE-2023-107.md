# Question ITE-2023-107

A 70-year-old male with hypertension sees you because of a syncopal episode. During the examination you ask him to move from a supine position to standing. Which one of the following results of this maneuver would confirm a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension?

## Options

**A.** He becomes lightheaded

**B.** He feels chest pain

**C.** His systolic blood pressure decreases by at least 10 mm Hg

**D.** His systolic blood pressure decreases by at least 20 mm Hg

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Orthostatic hypotension, which is more prevalent in older adults, is defined as a decrease of at least 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure or a drop of at least 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing from the supine position. There are multiple etiologies, both neurogenic and nonneurogenic. Clinical symptoms are not a preferred method of diagnosing orthostatic hypotension.
