# Question ITE-2024-035

## Question
A 48 -year-old female with a history of Crohn disease that has been poorly controlled for the past 4 –6 
months is admitted to the hospital. She has a BMI of 15 kg/m2 and has unintentionally lost more than 
18% of her body weight in this same span of time. Her potassium level is 3.3 mEq/L (N 3.5– 5.2) and 
her phosphorous level is 2.6 mg/dL (N 3.0 –4.5). 
 In addition to treating her Crohn disease, you should address her ma lnourished condition by initiating 
thiamine followed by refeeding and electrolytes using which one of the following strategies?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Providing less than her expected calorie requirements and replenishing electrolytes immediately
**B)** Providing her full expected calorie requirements and replenishing electrolytes immediately
**C)** Providing her full expected calorie requirements and delaying replenishment of electrolytes for 6 hours
**D)** Providing more than her expected calorie requirements and replenishing electrolytes immediately
**E)** Providing more than her expected calorie requirements and delaying replenishment of electrolytes for 6 hours

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient meets the criteria for being at high risk of developing refeeding syndrome (RFS) with a BMI <16 kg/m ². In addition to her BMI she has had an unintentional weight loss of >15% in the past 3 –6 months, and low levels of potassium and phosphorus prior to therapy. Another major risk factor is little or no nutrition for >10 days. Even patients who have lower risk for RFS than this patient should init ially receive as little as 25% –50% of their estimated caloric requirements, and their nutrition gradually increased. Electrolytes, especially magnesium, potassium, and phosphate, should be replenished immediately and closely monitored as calorie initiation will drive these electrolytes intracellularly. Minor risk factors for RFS include a BMI <18.5 kg/m ², a weight loss of >10% in the preceding 3 –6 months, little or no nutrition for >5 days, and a history of alcohol or drug abuse.
