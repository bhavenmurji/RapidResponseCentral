# Question ITE-2024-041

## Question
An 80 -year-old male who is taking furosemide (Lasix), 80 mg, for heart failure presents to the 
emergency department (ED) with a gradual onset of somnolence. He is found to be hyponatremic 
with a serum sodium level of 104 mEq/L (N 135 –145).  
 
You should orde r the administration of which one of the following?

## Answer Choices
**A)** 100 mL of 3% sodium chloride over 10 minutes
**B)** 150 mL of 5% sodium chloride over 30 minutes
**C)** 500 mL of 3% sodium chloride over 30 minutes
**D)** with a gradual onset of somnolence. He is found to be hyponatremic with a serum sodium level of 104 mEq/L (N 135 –145). You should orde r the administration of which one of the following?
**E)** 1 L of 3% sodium chloride over 1 hour

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Current guidelines recommend correction of the serum sodium level by 4 –6 mEq/L within 1 –2 hours, which can reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy. This may be accomplished with either a 100 -mL or 150 -mL bolus of 3% sodium chloride administered over 10 –20 minu tes and repeated 2 –3 times until the desired sodium level is achieved.
