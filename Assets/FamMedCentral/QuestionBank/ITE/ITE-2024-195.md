# Question ITE-2024-195

## Question
A 52 -year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of what he describes 
as the worst headache of his life. You are concerned about the possibility of an intracranial 
hemorrhage.  
 After performing an examination to rule out neurologic deficits, which one of the follo
wing would be 
the most appropriate next step in evaluation?

## Answer Choices
**A)** CT of the head without contrast
**B)** CT of the head with contrast
**C)** MRI of the head with and without contrast
**D)** A lumbar puncture

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
A patient describing a headache as the worst headache of their life can be a red -flag symptom of an intracranial hemorrhage, and CT of the head without contrast is the recommended next step in evaluation. Contrast should not be used because it can obscure the signs of bleeding. If a subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected, CT of the head should be completed before performing a lumbar puncture to ensure there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift.
