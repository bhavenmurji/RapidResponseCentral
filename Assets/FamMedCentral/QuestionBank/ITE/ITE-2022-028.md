Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?

## Options

**A.** Exogenous thyroid hormone use

**B.** Graves disease

**C.** Painless thyroiditis

**D.** Recent excess iodine intake

**E.** Toxic multinodular goiter

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient has a low serum TSH level in the presence of normal free T4 and total or free T3 levels, which
is consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. The etiology of overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism
should be determined by clinical symptoms, biochemical markers, and, if indicated, diagnostic studies such
as a radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan. A scan that shows multiple areas of increased and suppressed
uptake is consistent with toxic multinodular goiter. There is no RAIU with exogenous ingestion of thyroid
hormone, painless thyroiditis, and recent excess iodine intake. Graves disease causes diffuse RAIU.
It is important to determine the etiology of subclinical hyperthyroidism in order to treat it appropriately.
In patients who have TSH levels that are persistently <0.1 U/mL, the American Thyroid Association
has a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) for treating patients 65 years of age and
older; persons with cardiac risk factors, heart disease, or oste...
