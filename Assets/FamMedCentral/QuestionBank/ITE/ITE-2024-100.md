# Question ITE-2024-100

## Question
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening which one of the following groups 
for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?

## Answer Choices
**A)** ?
**B)** All adults who have ≥1 first -degree relative with documented OSA
**C)** All adults who have a BMI ≥35 kg/m2
**D)** All adults who have hypertension
**E)** No groups should be routinely screened

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
In November 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the current evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the general adult population (I recommendation). Th is applies to all adults ≥18 years of age without signs of OSA or with unrecognized symptoms of OSA. This recommendation also includes persons who are unaware of or are unconcerned by their symptoms.
