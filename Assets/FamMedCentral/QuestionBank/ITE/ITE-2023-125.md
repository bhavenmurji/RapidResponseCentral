# Question ITE-2023-125

You provide care for a 65-year-old female who has metastatic breast cancer. She would like to consider simple treatments and/or admissions, but wishes to avoid any further surgeries, heroic procedures, transfers to the ICU, or intubation. Which one of the following forms should you recommend as most beneficial for directing her end-of-life care?

## Options

**A.** Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) directives

**B.** A living will

**C.** A medical power of attorney

**D.** Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) forms are a portable order set signed by the provider and either the patient or the surrogate to direct care across various settings (including EMS, residential retirement facilities, nursing homes, emergency departments, and inpatient settings) at the end of life. The form is typically printed on bright-colored cardboard to make it easier to locate by EMS, with scanned versions available for electronic medical charts. It describes the patientâ€™s wishes for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and indicates the levels of care desired including full treatment, limited or selective interventions, and comfort-focused care. It is the best way to direct end-of-life patient care and respect diverse wishes. POLST forms are more useful than CPR directives because they describe broader end-of-life treatment choices. A living will is applicable only under the narrow conditions of a terminal or persistent vegetative state. A medical power of attorney is useful but does not convey values and wishes.
