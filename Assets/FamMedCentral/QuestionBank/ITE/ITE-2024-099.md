# Question ITE-2024-099

## Question
A previously healthy 67 -year-old female presents with a 3 -month history of new progressive low and 
middle back pain despite physical therapy and analgesics. She has also noted an onset of fatigue and weight loss. Results of a CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel are notable for normocytic 
anemia, hypercalcemia, and an elevated creatinine level.  
 
Which one of the following tests would help confirm the suspected diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti -CCP) antibody
**B)** Antimitochondrial antibody
**C)** Creatine phosphokinase
**D)** Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
**E)** Serum free light chains Item #98

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient’s case is highly consistent with multiple myeloma. In patients with suspected multiple myeloma, the measurement of serum free light chain levels as well as serum and urine protein electrophoresis can help confirm the diagnosis. Free light chains, including the subtypes kappa and lambda, are smaller components of immunoglobulins that are typically bound to heavy chains. In multiple myeloma, elevated levels of one of these unbound or "free" light chains can be found in the serum, or in the urine as the Bence Jones protein. A ratio of involved to uninvolved free light chains ≥100 and an involved free light chain concentration of ≥10 mg/dL is part of the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma. An anti –cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti -CCP) antibody test is used to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Testing for antimitochondrial antibodies is used to assess for primary biliary cirrhosis. A creatine phosphokinase test is used as a marke r of muscle damage. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a nonspecific marker of inflammation.
