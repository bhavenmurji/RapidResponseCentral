# Question ITE-2024-058

## Question
A 17 -year-old male sustains an injury while playing in a high school football game. As the sideline 
physician, you determine that he needs to be transported to the emergency department with neck 
stabilization. He is awake, talking, and in no acute distress. There is no concern for airway compromise.  
 Depending on the nature of his other injuries, which one of the following pieces of protective 
equipment should you remove befor e transporting the patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Only the helmet if required
**B)** Only the shoulder pads if required
**C)** Both the helmet and the shoulder pads
**D)** Neither the helmet nor the shoulder pads

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
In general, helmets and pads should remain in place during transportation after a football injury requiring neck stabilization. The facemask may be removed with a special tool if there are airway issues or loss of consciousness. If the athleteâ€™s injuries r equire either the helmet or pads to be removed, both should be removed by a trained team. Removal of only one can cause hyperflexion or hyperextension of the neck.
