# Question ITE-2022-036

erosions on her knees and elbows. She does not have any known connective tissue diseases, gastrointestinal disturbances, sexually transmitted infections, or recurrent exposures. A skin biopsy is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis. A positive test for which one of the following is most consistent with this diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Anti-thyroid antibodies

**B.** Herpes simplex virus antibody titers

**C.** Intrinsic factor antibodies

**D.** IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies

**E.** Varicella zoster virus antibody titers

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a very pruritic, papulovesicular reaction that is secondary to cutaneous IgA and
immune complex deposition related to gluten sensitivity, as in celiac disease. The majority of patients do
not have the gastrointestinal disturbances of celiac disease but do have the changes of gluten enteropathy
on small bowel biopsies. The diagnosis is supported by elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG)
antibodies, which is the serology of choice for diagnosing celiac disease. The rash frequently responds well
to a gluten-free diet and is classically treated with dapsone. The disease is not related to thyroid disease,
herpesviruses, or pernicious anemia.
