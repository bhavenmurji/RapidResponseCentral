# Question ITE-2023-083

For patients with terminal pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, or metastatic melanoma, which one of the following is the potential increase in life expectancy from receiving hospice care?

## Options

**A.** No increase

**B.** 3 months

**C.** 6 months

**D.** 9 months

**E.** 12 months

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Multiple retrospective cohort studies from 2007, 2014, and 2015 have demonstrated an increased life expectancy of up to 3.3 months for patients with terminal cancer, specifically terminal pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and metastatic melanoma, who received 3 or more days of hospice care. Some benefit was noted in patients with even 1 day of hospice care (SOR B). This extended life expectancy associated with hospice care was not observed in patients with terminal prostate or breast cancer. Family physicians should present the option of home hospice care to such patients early in their prognosis.
