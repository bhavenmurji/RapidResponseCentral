# Question ITE-2022-170

history of hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, headaches, flushing, or sweating. Which one of the following studies should be performed in patients found to have an adrenal incidentaloma?

## Options

**A.** An ACTH stimulation test

**B.** A dexamethasone suppression test

**C.** Paired serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity

**D.** Serum or urine metanephrines

**E.** A PET scan

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Adrenal incidentalomas usually do not produce overt hormone excess, but mild autonomous cortisol
secretion (MACS) is present in up to 30%â€“50% of cases. This mild secretion of cortisol may predispose
patients to metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular events. MACS can be ruled out with an
overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test. The remainder of the evaluation can be based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) on CT
findings and clinical symptoms.

An ACTH stimulation test is used to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency, which is not caused by an
adenoma. If no hypertension or hypokalemia are present, the serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity
paired values may not be necessary. Testing for metanephrines is indicated only if pheochromocytoma is
suspected. If no clinical symptoms of pheochromocytoma (such as hypertension, sweating, or headaches)
are present and the lesions are <10 Hounsfield units on CT, pheochromocytoma and malignancy are very
unlikely. A PET scan would not be indica...
