# Question ITE-2022-177

trauma. Her symptoms are most prominent when lifting her 4-month-old infant into his car seat. Which one of the following physical examination findings is most consistent with the likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Focal tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox

**B.** Focal tenderness over the triangular fibrocartilage complex

**C.** Pain reproduced by repeated percussion over the volar wrist

**D.** Pain reproduced by thumb passive circumduction with axial load to the first

**E.** Pain reproduced by ulnar wrist deviation with the thumb placed inside a closed fist

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient presents with a history of an atraumatic onset of radial-sided wrist pain that is typical of de

specifically the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. This injury is most common in women
30–50 years of age and often occurs in new mothers who frequently pick up a child. Pain localizes to the
radial styloid and is reproduced by Finkelstein’s test, which involves placing the thumb inside a closed fist
followed by ulnar deviation of the wrist. Focal tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox would suggest injury
to the scaphoid, which is in the differential diagnosis for radial-sided wrist pain, although it usually occurs
through direct trauma such as a fall onto an outstretched hand. Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage
complex is a common cause of ulnar-sided, rather than radial-sided, wrist pain. Repeated percussion over
the volar wrist with resultant pain a...
