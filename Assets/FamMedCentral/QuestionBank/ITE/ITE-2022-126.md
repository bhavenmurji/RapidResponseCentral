# Question ITE-2022-126

recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. She also has long-standing hypertension and her current medications include telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Micardis HCT), amlodipine (Norvasc), and metformin. Her most recent estimated glomerular filtration rate is 52 mL/min/1.73 m2 and her hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%. Her serum electrolytes are all within the normal range. You refer her to a diabetes educator for counseling on self-management and lifestyle modification. Which one of the following is the recommended additional pharmacologic treatment for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Empagliflozin (Jardiance)

**B.** Glipizide (Glucotrol)

**C.** Insulin glargine (Lantus)

**D.** Pioglitazone (Actos)

**E.** Sitagliptin (Januvia)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The American diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) Association and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group
recommend combination treatment with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor for patients with type 2 diabetes
and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Metformin is first-line medical therapy for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. The addition of
an SGLT2 inhibitor limits the progression of kidney disease and improves cardiac outcomes (SOR A).
They should be considered first-line treatment along with metformin regardless of the baseline or target
hemoglobin A1c.

Sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones would not be used as first-line therapy in this scenario. Their use is
now recommended secondarily only when cost is a major issue. Insulin is not indicated in this patient as
oral hypoglycemics are first-line therapy unless the hemoglobin A1c is >10% or the patient is experiencing
persistent symptoms of hyperglycemia. DPP...
