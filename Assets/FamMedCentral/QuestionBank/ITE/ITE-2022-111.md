# Question ITE-2022-111

physical examination reveals a small, pink, tender area of the upper eyelid with an adjacent, slightly inflamed gland opening at the eyelid margin. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial treatment?

## Options

**A.** Warm compresses and gentle massage of the eyelid

**B.** Topical moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox)

**C.** Topical tobramycin/dexamethasone ophthalmic solution 0.3%/0.1% (Tobradex)

**D.** Oral cephalexin (Keflex)

**E.** Incision and drainage

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has a hordeolum (stye). Typical first-line treatment is to apply warm compresses and perform
gentle massage of the area to promote drainage of the occluded gland. Antibiotics and incision and drainage
are not necessary unless surrounding cellulitis is present or there is failure to improve with initial therapy.
