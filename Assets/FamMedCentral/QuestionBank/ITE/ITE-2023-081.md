# Question ITE-2023-081

A 36-year-old female with recently diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) sees you to discuss treatment options. Her menses are irregular and she only has 2–3 cycles per year. She does not wish to have any more children. She has no contraindications to hormonal contraceptives. Her BMI is 27 kg/m2. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate medication to initiate as first-line PCOS therapy? 30 32 ---

## Options

**A.** Finasteride (Proscar)

**B.** Letrozole (Femara)

**C.** Metformin

**D.** Norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (Sprintec)

**E.** Spironolactone (Aldactone)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

While the second-line medications for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) continue to shift as the evidence is refined, the primary goal of protecting the endometrial lining from unopposed estrogen effects remains consistent. The first-line therapy for PCOS in women who do not desire pregnancy remains combined oral contraception and/or progestin-containing contraceptives. Finasteride, letrozole, metformin, and spironolactone are second-line treatments for specific conditions caused by PCOS such as type 2 diabetes, anovulatory oligomenorrhea, infertility, and hirsutism.
