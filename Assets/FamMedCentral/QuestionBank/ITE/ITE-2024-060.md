# Question ITE-2024-060

## Question
A previously healthy 72 -year-old female presents to your office 7 days after hospitalization for an 
acute ischemic stroke diagnosed by MRI.  The inpatient evaluation confirmed that she experienced a 
minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. She was not a candidate for reperfusion therapy and did not 
receive rtPA. Her family reports that her speech impairment and confusion have completely resolved  
and that she is now back to her baseline.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy  at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A direct oral anticoagulant
**B)** Low-molecular -weight heparin
**C)** A vitamin K antagonist
**D)** Single antiplatelet therapy
**E)** Dual antiplatelet therapy

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient has been diagnosed with a minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke and should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 –90 days post stroke (SOR A). The benefit of reducing recurrent stroke risk outweighs the risk for major bleeding. Using aspirin and clopidogrel longer than 90 days offers no additional benefit but results in significantly increased bleeding risk compared to using single antiplatelet therapy. Following 21 –90 days post stroke, either aspirin monotherapy or aspirin in combination with dipyridamole may be used indefinitely. If a cardioembolic source is later diagnosed, appropriate anticoagulation therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant or vitamin K antagonist, such as warfarin, can be initiated. Low-molecular -weight heparin does not play a role in secondary stroke prevention.
