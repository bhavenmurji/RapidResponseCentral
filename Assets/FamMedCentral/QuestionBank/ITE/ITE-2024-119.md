# Question ITE-2024-119

## Question
A 71 -year-old male with no significant past medical history presents to establish care now that he has 
health insurance. He has not seen a doctor in more than 20 years. He has no symptoms or current 
health concerns, and he does not take any medications. He quit smoking 18 years ago after smoking 2 
packs per day for  30 years. He rarely drinks alcohol and regularly bicycles for exercise. He has not 
been sexually active since his partner died 12 years ago. He has a blood pressure of 129/89 mm Hg, a 
heart rate of 86 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 16/min, and a BMI of 26 kg/m2. Physical examination 
findings are normal.  
 
Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, which one of the following screening tests 
is recommended for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bone density testing
**B)** Hemoglobin A 1c
**C)** Hepatitis C antibody testing
**D)** HIV testing
**E)** Low-dose chest CT

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in persons at risk for infection and also one -time screenings for all adults between 18 and 79 years of age (B recommendation). The USPSTF gives an I recommendation to bone density screening. Diabetes mellitus screening with a hemoglobin A 1c is not recommended because this patient is 71 years of age. Screening is recommended in adults 35âˆ’70 years of age with a BMI that is in the overweight or obese ca tegories. This patient is over the age of 65 and no risk factors are noted, so HIV screening is not indicated. Lung cancer screening with low -dose CT of the chest is not recommended because the patient quit smoking >15 years ago.
