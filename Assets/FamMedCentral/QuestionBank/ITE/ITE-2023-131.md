# Question ITE-2023-131

A 9-year-old child is brought to your office for evaluation of right wrist pain after a fall from a swing at recess this morning. On examination you note tenderness and swelling over the lateral aspect of the distal radius. Radiographs are shown below. Which one of the following would be most appropriate for this injury?

## Options

**A.** A cock-up wrist splint

**B.** A double sugar-tong splint

**C.** A figure-of-8 sling

**D.** A short arm cast

**E.** A long arm cast

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has a distal radius buckle fracture (or torus fracture) and a cock-up wrist splint is appropriate. Buckle fractures are stable because they only involve the bony cortex (outer layer), and the goal of treatment is the alleviation of pain and protecting the bone from further injury. A double sugar-tong splint more completely immobilizes the humerus, radius, and ulna and is not necessary for this type of fracture. A figure-of-8 sling is an option in the treatment of clavicle fractures and is not appropriate for radius fractures. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that patients treated with splint immobilization had better recovery of wrist motion, quicker return to normal activity, and less overall disability while also experiencing fewer complications than those immobilized with a cast. Patients and their families also preferred splint immobilization and stated they would choose splints over casts if needed in the future. 51
