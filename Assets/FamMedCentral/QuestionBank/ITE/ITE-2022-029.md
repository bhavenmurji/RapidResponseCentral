# Question ITE-2022-029

a recent diagnosis of a high-grade lymphoma and is undergoing aggressive chemotherapy. His last chemotherapy session was 2 days ago. An examination is nonspecific. Initial laboratory studies reveal a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL (N 0.6â€“1.2). His baseline creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL. Which one of the following laboratory findings would be expected in this patient?

## Options

**A.** Hypercalcemia

**B.** Hyperuricemia

**C.** Hypokalemia

**D.** Hypophosphatemia

**E.** Low LDH

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Tumor lysis syndrome is considered the most common oncologic emergency. It is caused by the rapid
release of intracellular material from lysis of the malignant cells. The breakdown of nucleic acids releases
large amounts of uric acid and leads to acute kidney failure, which limits clearance of potassium,
phosphorus, and uric acid. This leads to hyperuricemia, secondary hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and
hyperphosphatemia. It can result in acute renal failure, arrhythmia, seizure, and sudden death. While
tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with many cancer types, it is more common with acute leukemia
and high-grade lymphomas. Patients with this condition generally present within 7 days of cancer
treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or biologic therapies. It can also occur spontaneously. An
LDH elevation related to a high cell turnover rate prior to cancer treatment may indicate an increased risk
of tumor lysis syndrome. Hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and low LDH ...
