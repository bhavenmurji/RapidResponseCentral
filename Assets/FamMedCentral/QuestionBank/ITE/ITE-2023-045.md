# Question ITE-2023-045

A 20-year-old college student comes to your office on Monday morning after injuring his right arm during a rugby match 2 days earlier. He is not certain of the mechanism of injury but was struck forcefully on the lower posterior part of his upper arm above the elbow. He describes paresthesias on the extensor side of his forearm and the back of his hand. His upper arm is bruised and mildly swollen at the described location. In addition to the paresthesias on the extensor forearm and the back of the hand, which one of the following motor findings would you expect? 16 18 ---

## Options

**A.** An inability to maintain all fingers fanned out under resistance

**B.** Weakness of elbow flexion with the hand in a prone position

**C.** Weakness of finger and wrist extension under resistance

**D.** Weakness of flexion of the fourth and fifth fingers

**E.** Weakness of thumb apposition

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This student athlete likely has a contusion to the radial nerve in the spiral groove of the distal humerus, resulting in the so-called “Saturday night palsy” after undue pressure on the distal upper arm. This could be the result of significant direct pressure over several hours, or such an injury could happen acutely, as in the described scenario. Findings include paresthesias and possible decreased light or sharp touch sensation on the back of the hand and extensor forearm. Motor findings include weakness of finger and wrist extension, best evaluated by testing while the examiner applies resistance to the actions. Thumb apposition is controlled by the median nerve and splaying out the fingers (lumbricals) is mainly an ulnar nerve function. Unless the nerve has been severed, the sensory loss and motor weakness typically resolve within days to weeks.
