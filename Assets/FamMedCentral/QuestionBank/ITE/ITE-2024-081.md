# Question ITE-2024-081

## Question
Which one of the following cardiovascular changes reflects normal physiology of pregnancy in the 
first trimester?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Decreased resting heart rate
**B)** Increased afterload
**C)** Increased preload
**D)** Increased systemic vascular resistance
**E)** Increased systolic blood pressure

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Several notable changes occur within the maternal cardiovascular system in the first trimester of pregnancy. A rise in cardiac output results from a combination of 3 primary factors: plasma volume expansion that causes an increase in preload, a decrease in afterload that mirrors a decline in systemic vascular resistance, and an increase in the resting heart rate compared to the pre -pregnancy state. Other cardiovascular changes early in the course of pregnancy include a reduction in both systolic and diastol ic blood pressures compared to pre -pregnancy measurements.
