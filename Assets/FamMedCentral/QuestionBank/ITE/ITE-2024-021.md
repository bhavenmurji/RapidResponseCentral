# Question ITE-2024-021

## Question
Which one of the following is associated with at least 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding in infants?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Higher incidence of infant peanut allergy
**B)** Higher infant HDL -cholesterol levels
**C)** Lower risk for infant atopic dermatitis
**D)** Lower maternal incidence of endometrial cancer
**E)** Lower maternal incidence of hypothyroidism

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Exclusively breastfeeding infants for at least 6 months confers multiple health benefits to both the mother and the infant. Breastfeeding persons have decreased risks for breast and ovarian cancers, postpartum depression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Breastfed infants have decreased risks for atopic dermatitis and gastroenteritis. Other potential infant benefits, based on observational studies, include lower risks for childhood leukemia, hypertension, obesity, otitis media, sudden infant death syndrome, and type 1 and 2 diabetes.
