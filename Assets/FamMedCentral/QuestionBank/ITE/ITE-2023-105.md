# Question ITE-2023-105

An 18-year-old female with a BMI of 21 kg/m2 sees you for evaluation of recent hair loss and amenorrhea. During the review of systems she tells you that she thinks she is fat and reveals that she recently went on a restrictive diet and lost 15% of her body weight. On examination she is ill appearing, and her affect is blunted. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and her heart rate is 50 beats/min. Laboratory testing reveals euthyroid sick syndrome and a decreased serum calcium level. Bone mineral density (BMD) testing shows bone loss. You refer her for extensive psychologic intervention. Once this patient begins showing signs of improvement, the best indication for recovery of BMD would be 40 42 ---

## Options

**A.** increased food intake

**B.** a normal calcium level

**C.** normal thyroid studies

**D.** the return of menses

**E.** weight restoration

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient has anorexia nervosa. While weight restoration is important, the return of menses is the best indication of bone mineral density (BMD) recovery. Increased food intake, a normal calcium level, and normal thyroid function are important but not indicative of BMD recovery.
