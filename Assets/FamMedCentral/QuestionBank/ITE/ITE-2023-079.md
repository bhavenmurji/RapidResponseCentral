# Question ITE-2023-079

An otherwise healthy 70-year-old male presents with a 6-month history of hives recurring every week or so. A causative factor is not identified through the history and physical examination. Which one of the following is recommended as the first-line treatment for this patientâ€™s chronic urticaria?

## Options

**A.** A first-generation H1-antihistamine

**B.** A second-generation H1-antihistamine

**C.** An H2-antihistamine

**D.** Omalizumab (Xolair)

**E.** Prednisone

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

A stepwise method is recommended for the treatment of chronic urticaria of unknown cause. The first step is the regular use of a second-generation H1-antihistamine. An increase of up to four times the approved dosage is safe and may be helpful as part of step two. If the urticaria is still poorly controlled, an H2-antihistamine or antileukotriene agent may be added in step two. Systemic corticosteroids can be used for short-term control of severe acute episodes, but long-term use should be avoided. First-generation H1-antihistamines can be used if control cannot be achieved at step two, but they should be used cautiously, as sedation and confusion may occur, especially in the elderly. The options available in the third step of treatment are omalizumab and cyclosporine.
