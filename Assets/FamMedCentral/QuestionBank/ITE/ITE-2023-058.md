# Question ITE-2023-058

In a patient with hyperuricemia with an elevated uric acid level but no prior episodes of acute gout, which one of the following is recommended?

## Options

**A.** No urate-lowering medication

**B.** Allopurinol (Zyloprim), 100 mg daily

**C.** Febuxostat (Uloric), 40 mg daily

**D.** Naproxen, 250 mg three times daily

**E.** Probenecid, 100 mg twice daily

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Uric acid–lowering treatment is recommended for all patients with an elevated uric acid level who have had two or more gout flareups per year. Consider starting it in patients with a second flareup occurring more than 1 year later, those without an attack but who are at high risk, such as in those with kidney stones, patients with a uric acid level 9.0 mg/dL, or patients with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease. There is no benefit for urate lowering in asymptomatic patients with an elevated uric acid level who have never had an acute episode of gout, thus allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid would not be appropriate. NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids are recommended for gout prophylaxis for the first 3–6 months after initiating urate-lowering therapy to prevent acute flares, but this patient has no history of acute gout. Additionally, vitamin C is not effective.
