# Question ITE-2023-167

A 66-year-old female with a past medical history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes diagnosed at age 60 presents for a health maintenance examination. She was previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax 23) at the time of her diabetes diagnosis. Based on CDC guidelines, which one of the following should you recommend to her today to complete her pneumococcal vaccination series?

## Options

**A.** No additional pneumococcal vaccine

**B.** A repeat dose of PPSV23

**C.** 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, Prevnar 13)

**D.** 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15, Vaxneuvance)

**E.** 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20, Prevnar 20)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

In patients who were previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine between the ages of 19 and 64 due to risk factors such as type 2 diabetes, the CDC now recommends one dose of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
