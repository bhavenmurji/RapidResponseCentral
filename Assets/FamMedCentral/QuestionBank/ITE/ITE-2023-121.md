# Question ITE-2023-121

Which one of the following supplements has been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in people who smoke?

## Options

**A.** -Carotene

**B.** Magnesium

**C.** Vitamin B2

**D.** Vitamin B12

**E.** Vitamin C

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

While many supplements are harmless, -carotene has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers and increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality. It can also cause reversible skin yellowing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against (D recommendation) -carotene supplementation for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the use of magnesium, vitamin B2, or vitamin B12 for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. Vitamin C can increase the risk of nephrolithiasis.
