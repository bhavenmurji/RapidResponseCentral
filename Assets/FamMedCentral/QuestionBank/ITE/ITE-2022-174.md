# Question ITE-2022-174

a BMI of 17 kg/m2, a heart rate of 66 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 110/64 mm Hg. The patient reports exercising for 2 hours each day, incorporating cardio and light weights. The patient presents a detailed food diary and asks for advice about how to adjust her nutrition to lose weight. In order to provide the best care for this patient, which one of the following would you order?

## Options

**A.** A fecal calprotectin level

**B.** Stool cultures

**C.** A DEXA scan

**D.** Chest radiography

**E.** Thyroid ultrasonography

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patient likely has an eating disorder. A DEXA scan is recommended to assess for low bone mineral
density in patients with suspected or diagnosed eating disorders. Other appropriate screenings include
orthostatic vital signs; a basic metabolic panel; a CBC; magnesium, phosphorus, prealbumin, and amylase
levels; thyroid testing; and an EKG. Fecal calprotectin levels, stool cultures, chest radiography, and
thyroid ultrasonography are not appropriate for this patient.
