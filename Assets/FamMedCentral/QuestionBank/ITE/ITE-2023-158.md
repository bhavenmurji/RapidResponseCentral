# Question ITE-2023-158

A 27-year-old male with no significant medical history presents for evaluation of a new onset of blood in his semen occurring on three occasions over the past 10 days. He has not had any additional genitourinary, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms. He has no personal history of tobacco use and he is sexually active with his wife only. A physical examination, including a genitourinary examination, is unremarkable. A CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, urinalysis and culture, and sexually transmitted infection screening are all normal. Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?

## Options

**A.** Reassurance and no additional testing

**B.** A PSA level

**C.** Ultrasonography of the scrotum and prostate

**D.** CT of the abdomen and pelvis

**E.** Referral to a urologist

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

In most cases, hematospermia (visible blood in the ejaculate) is benign and self-limiting, often caused by infection or inflammation of the genitourinary tract. Other potential etiologies include trauma or iatrogenic injury, systemic diseases including severe uncontrolled hypertension or a bleeding disorder, cysts, calculi, or prolonged abstinence. Hematospermia is rarely caused by genitourinary cancer, and underlying malignancy is particularly unlikely in men <40 years of age with new-onset hematospermia. Although acute-onset hematospermia may cause great distress to the patient, if the initial evaluation is unrevealing the most appropriate intervention for a man <40 years of age is reassurance that the problem will likely self-resolve, with the recommendation to return for follow-up if the problem persists or recurs. Further evaluation with PSA testing and referral to a urologist is indicated for men with symptoms persisting beyond 10 occasions or 1 monthâ€™s duration and for men over 40 years of age. After an unremarkable history, examination, and basic laboratory workup, the next step is to provide reassurance with appropriate return precautions. PSA testing, ultrasonography of the scrotum and prostate, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and referral to a urologist are not warranted at this time.
