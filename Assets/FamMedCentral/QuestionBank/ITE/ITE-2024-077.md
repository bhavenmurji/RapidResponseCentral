# Question ITE-2024-077

## Question
A 24 -month -old male is brought to your office by his parent. During the examination you notice that 
he seems to speak fewer words than expected and is very hard to understand. He does not use 2- word 
phrases, cannot point to any body parts, and has difficulty pointing to items in a book. On further 
questioning the parent confirms that the toddler speaks fewe r than 50 words. Both English and 
German are spoken in his home.  
 
Which one of the following factors puts this patient at risk for the likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Being the first born
**B)** Being the last born
**C)** A birth weight ≥5000 g (11 lb)
**D)** Growing up in a multilingual household
**E)** Male sex

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This toddler’s delay in speech and language development is a common impairment that affects 1 in 8 children in the United States. School -aged children with speech and language delays are at greater risk for difficulty learning to read, putting them at risk for less skilled jobs in adulthood. The development of speech and language occurs in the first 6 months of life and is marked by distinct milestones according to age. Because exposure to language in early childhood influences a child’s language mastery, p arents and caregivers play an important role in the development of speech and language. When patients present with concerning signs for delays in speech and language development, early referrals for additional evaluation and treatment can mitigate the adverse effects on academic and social development. A large study found that the most import ant risk factor for speech and language impairment was male sex. Other risk factors included ongoing hearing problems and birth weight ≤2500 g (5.5 lb). Birth order does not have an adverse association with speech and language development. Children growing up in bilingual households should reach language milestones at the same rate as those in monolingual households.
