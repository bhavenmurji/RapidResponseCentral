# Question ITE-2022-068

knees, and elbows. She says that when she tries to remove the scales they often bleed. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Clobetasol propionate 0.05% lotion (Clobex)

**B.** Selenium sulfide 2.5% lotion

**C.** Permethrin cream (Nix)

**D.** Terbinafine cream 1%

**E.** Loratadine (Claritin), 10 mg daily

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has psoriasis that is characterized by plaques on her extensor extremities and limited bleeding
with removal of the scales (Auspitz sign). First-line treatment for localized plaques is topical corticosteroid
therapy, such as clobetasol propionate lotion. Antifungals such as selenium sulfide lotion and terbinafine
cream are used to treat dermatophytosis infections including tinea pedis and tinea versicolor. Permethrin
cream is indicated for treatment of scabies and lice. Loratadine, an oral antihistamine, is used to treat
urticaria.
