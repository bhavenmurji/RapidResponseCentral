# Question ITE-2022-181

of a provoked proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg?

## Options

**A.** 6 weeks

**B.** 3 months

**C.** 9 months

**D.** 1 year

**E.** Lifelong

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The 2016 CHEST guideline and expert panel report gives a strong recommendation (Grade 1B) to support
3 months of anticoagulation after a first episode of a provoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of
the leg. Treatment for 3 months appears to be superior to shorter treatment (6 weeks) with regard to
recurrence of DVT. Treatment regimens >6 months for an unprovoked DVT may slightly reduce the rate
of recurrence, but this is offset by an increased rate of bleeding and mortality.
