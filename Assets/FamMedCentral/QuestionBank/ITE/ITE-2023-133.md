# Question ITE-2023-133

An 82-year-old male requires a walker for ambulation. To be eligible for home health services, Medicare requires a patient to be homebound. The patient reports that leaving home is difficult and exhausting. Which one of the following conditions could disqualify a patient from being considered homebound?

## Options

**A.** Attending a support group at an adult day care program two times per week

**B.** Going to the grocery store three times per week

**C.** Attending his church for Mass three times per week

**D.** Going to outpatient dialysis three times per week

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

A Medicare beneficiary must meet certain criteria to be considered homebound and obtain home health services. The first criterion is that when leaving the home, the patient requires the assistance of another person, special transportation, or a support device such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair. Alternatively, a medical contraindication to leaving home could exist. If the first criterion is met, there must be a normal inability to leave home and leaving requires a considerable and taxing effort. It is stipulated that attending religious services, therapeutic or psychosocial treatment at a licensed adult day care program, or outpatient dialysis or cancer treatments should not disqualify a patient from being considered homebound. Visiting the grocery store is not stipulated as an exception.
