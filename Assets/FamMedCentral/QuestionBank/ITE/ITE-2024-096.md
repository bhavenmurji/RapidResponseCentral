# Question ITE-2024-096

## Question
Which one of the following studies should be obtained in all toddlers with suspected physical abuse?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A funduscopic examination
**B)** Skeletal survey radiography
**C)** Head CT without contrast
**D)** Abdominal CT with contrast
**E)** A bone scan

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Radiology guidelines recommend that all children with suspected physical abuse undergo a skeletal survey, particularly those who are â‰¤2 years of age. A funduscopic examination should be obtaine d if retinal hemorrhages are suspected in children <2 years. Head CT without contrast is indicated if there is a concern for subdural, subarachnoid, or intraparenchymal injury. Abdominal CT with contrast is recommended if there is a concern for intra -abdom inal injuries. A bone scan should be obtained if there is a concern for occult fractures up to 2 weeks after injury.
