# Question ITE-2023-033

In a patient with new-onset polymyalgia rheumatica, which one of the following medications can be added to glucocorticoid therapy in order to reduce the risk of relapse? 12 14 ---

## Options

**A.** Ibuprofen

**B.** Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa)

**C.** Indomethacin

**D.** Mesalamine

**E.** Methotrexate

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) should be treated with glucocorticoids to induce remission. There is good evidence that adjunctive therapy with methotrexate reduces both the cumulative dose of corticosteroids needed and the risk of relapse (evidence rating A). NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and indomethacin reduce pain but do not modify the inflammatory process. Icosapent ethyl is a derivative of omega-3 fatty acids that reduces cardiovascular events and may improve rheumatoid arthritis, likely via anti-inflammatory properties. However, it has not been shown to be effective in PMR. Mesalamine is used to reduce inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease but is not effective against PMR.
