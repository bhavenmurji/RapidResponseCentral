# Question ITE-2023-166

A 67-year-old male presents for a preoperative evaluation before a knee replacement. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, for which he is taking apixaban (Eliquis). Which one of the following would be the most appropriate approach to managing anticoagulation prior to surgery? (Lovenox) 61 63 ---

## Options

**A.** Continuing apixaban therapy during the perioperative period

**B.** Discontinuing apixaban for 2 days prior to the procedure without bridging

**C.** Discontinuing apixaban for 2 days prior to the procedure, and bridging with enoxaparin

**D.** Discontinuing apixaban for 5 days prior to the procedure without bridging

**E.** Discontinuing apixaban for 5 days prior to the procedure, and bridging with enoxaparin

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Patients taking apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation should discontinue the medication for 1â€“2 days prior to the procedure without bridging. This approach is associated with a low risk of bleeding complications without increasing the incidence of thromboembolism. The choice between 1 and 2 days depends on the bleeding risk associated with the procedure.
