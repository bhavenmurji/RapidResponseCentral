# Question ITE-2023-174

A 15-year-old male is brought to the clinic for evaluation of his eating habits. His parents note that on several occasions they have found him alone with multiple empty food packages. He confirms that yesterday he consumed two fried chicken sandwiches, two orders of French fries, and two milkshakes in a 1-hour time period in which he was alone in his room. After this episode he was uncomfortably full for several hours. Which one of the following would support your suspicion that this individual has binge-eating disorder?

## Options

**A.** Distorted body image

**B.** Feeling content after eating

**C.** Markedly low body weight for age and sex

**D.** Sense of loss of control during overeating episodes

**E.** Use of laxatives to control weight

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening. The true prevalence of eating disorders is unclear, but it is estimated that 2%–4% of adolescents may meet criteria for binge-eating disorder (BED) with equal distribution across gender. The DSM-5 has specific criteria for diagnosing eating disorders. BED has several key features, including recurrent episodes of binge eating. Binge eating occurs in a distinct period of time and consists of consuming an amount of food outside the accepted norms for a meal, typically 3000–5000 kcal, and experiencing a sense of loss of control during the episode. Distorted body image and markedly low body weight for age and sex are seen in anorexia nervosa. There is no weight specification in the diagnostic criteria for BED and it is estimated that 50% of those suffering with BED are overweight or obese. Patients with BED feel a sense of distress, anguish, or despair (not contentment) after the eating episode and regarding this eating pattern in general. The use of laxatives to control weight or compensate for binge eating is typically seen with bulimia nervosa.
