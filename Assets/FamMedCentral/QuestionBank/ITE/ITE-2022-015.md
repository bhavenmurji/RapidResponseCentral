# Question ITE-2022-015

is associated with a higher risk of developing adhesive capsulitis compared with the general population?

## Options

**A.** Addison’s disease

**B.** Diabetes mellitus

**C.** Hyperparathyroidism

**D.** Hypertension

**E.** Rheumatoid arthritis

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

According to a 2016 meta-analysis, patients with diabetes mellitus were five times more likely than the
control group to have adhesive capsulitis. The same study also found the prevalence of diabetes in patients
with adhesive capsulitis to be about 30%. Because of this high prevalence, screening for diabetes with a
fasting glucose level or hemoglobin A1c is recommended in patients with adhesive capsulitis who have not
previously been diagnosed with diabetes. There is no evidence to support screening for Addison’s disease
or rheumatoid arthritis in patients with adhesive capsulitis (SOR C). Hyperparathyroidism and hypertension
are not associated with adhesive capsulitis.
