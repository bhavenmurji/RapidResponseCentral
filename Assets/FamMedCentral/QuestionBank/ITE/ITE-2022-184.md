# Question ITE-2022-184

anterolateral left thigh. He has not had any injury, back pain, radiation of pain, or weakness. He has not noticed any exacerbating or remitting factors. He has type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 37 kg/m2, and his job is sedentary. An examination reveals normal deep tendon reflexes in the patella and ankle, and the straight leg raising test is negative bilaterally. His strength is preserved throughout his lower extremities. His pinprick sensation is slightly reduced along the anterolateral thigh. Burning discomfort is reproduced with tapping over the lateral aspect of the inguinal ligament. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Cauda equina syndrome

**B.** Diabetic neuropathy

**C.** Femoral neuropathy

**D.** Left S1 radiculopathy

**E.** Meralgia paresthetica

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Meralgia paresthetica is a common cause of anterolateral hip pain and dysesthesia. It is caused by
compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve as it courses under the inguinal ligament into the
subcutaneous tissue of the thigh. Tapping over this area during the examination can reproduce symptoms.
Obesity is a common cause due to compression of the nerve from overlying pannus. Diabetes mellitus is
associated with a sevenfold higher incidence over the general population. Cauda equina syndrome presents
with saddle anesthesia and generally marked neurologic disability. Diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral
neuropathy initially affecting distal structures such as the toes and feet. Femoral neuropathy would affect
sensation in the anteromedial thigh and medial lower leg with weakness in the quadriceps muscle group.
The anterolateral thigh would represent the L3-L4 dermatome rather than S1, and the normal straight leg
raising test and absence of back pain are evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) against an S1 issue...
