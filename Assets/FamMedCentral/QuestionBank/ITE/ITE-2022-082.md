# Question ITE-2022-082

spine might be curved. The most appropriate evaluation for scoliosis at this point is

## Options

**A.** comparing the length from the pelvic brim to the pelvic floor on the left and the right

**B.** scoliometer measurement with the patient bent over to 90°

**C.** scoliometer measurement with the patient upright and arms to her side

**D.** determination of the Cobb angle with the patient bent over to 90°

**E.** determination of the Cobb angle with the patient upright and arms to her side

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The forward bend test, combined with a scoliometer measurement, is the most appropriate initial test when
evaluating for scoliosis. A scoliometer should be used with the patient’s spine parallel to the floor (bent
over to approximately 90°), with the arms hanging down, palms together, and feet pointing forward. If
5°–7° of trunk rotation is assessed by the scoliometer or by a scoliometer app on a smartphone,
radiography can be performed to assess the Cobb angle. This radiography should be performed with the
patient upright. A Cobb angle >20° may signify scoliosis, which may benefit from bracing, depending
on skeletal maturity. Comparing the length from the pelvic brim to the pelvic floor on the left and the right
is not indicated in the evaluation for scoliosis.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force changed its recommendation for scoliosis screening from grade
D to grade I in 2018. Bracing has been found to reduce by over 50% the chance that mild to moderate
curvatures will progress ...
