# Question ITE-2024-101

## Question
A 62 -year-old male presents to your office with a 3 -month history of increasing dyspnea and cough. 
He has a history of allergic rhinitis and uses fluticasone propionate nasal spray (Flonase) daily. He 
has a 15 -pack-year smoking history but quit more than 20 years ago. He has a family history of 
asthma in both his mother and 1 sibling.  
 
Examination findings include a respiratory rate of 18/min and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room 
air. His lung sounds are diminished with scattered rhonchi and no wheezes. The remainder of the 
examination findings are normal. Spirometry shows an FEV 1/FVC ratio of 0.6 and the FEV 1 is 70% 
of predicted with no improvement with a bronchodilator.  
 Which one of the following is the most likely cause of his dyspnea?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Asthma
**B)** Bronchiectasis
**C)** COPD
**D)** Heart failure
**E)** Pulmonary fibrosis

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
The most likely cause of this patient’s dyspnea is COPD. This patient has an obstructive pattern on spirometry with an FEV 1/FVC ratio <0.7 and no improvement with administration of a bronchodilator, which rules out asthma and is consistent with COPD. Bronchiectasis is associated with a purulent cough and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections on imaging. Heart failure is unlikely because there are no signs of fluid overload and this patient’s presentation is more consistent with COPD. Pulmonary fibros is shows a restrictive pattern on spirometry.
