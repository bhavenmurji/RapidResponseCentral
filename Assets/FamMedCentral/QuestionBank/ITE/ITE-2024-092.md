# Question ITE-2024-092

## Question
A 68 -year-old male presents to your office because of a sudden onset of pain and cold sensation in 
the right lower leg that began 3 hours ago. He rates his pain as 9 out of 10. He has a past medical 
history of hypertension, coronary artery disease with a c oronary artery bypass graft 3 years ago, and 
stage 3a chronic kidney disease. He currently smokes cigarettes.  
 
His vital signs include a blood pressure of 160/85 mm Hg, a heart rate of 99 beats/min with regular 
rhythm, a respiratory rate of 18/min, and an  oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. An examination 
reveals a right lower leg that is cold at the midcalf and right foot without palpable or Doppler pedal 
pulses. Doppler imaging reveals a venous hum. His capillary refill is very slow, and there is a los s of 
pinprick sensation in all of the toes of the right foot. His motor ability is maintained. You hear a 
possible faint bruit over the right femoral artery.  
 
Which one of the following is the most appropriate next 

## Answer Choices
**A)** Urgent outpatient echocardiography
**B)** Urgent outpatient arteriography of the right leg
**C)** Emergent referral to the emergency department (E
**D)** for evaluation by a vascular subspecialist
**E)** Hospital admission for heparin infusion

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient has acute limb ischemia (ALI), a medical emergency with possible irreversible limb loss within 4 –6 hours. According to the American Heart Association, emergent revascularization is recommended to salvage this patient’s limb. An emergent referr al to a vascular subspecialist is the most appropriate immediate action. Depending on location, this may be a vascular surgeon, a radiologist with invasive vascular treatment ability, or a cardiovascular or general surgeon with peripheral vascular training and expertise. Determining the source of the thrombosis is not as urgent as limb salvage. Arteriography is a possible aspect of limb salvage but is not the entire procedure. Aspirin, nitroglycerin, and transfer to an emergency department is appropriate fo r acute coronary thrombosis but not for ALI. Anticoagulation is required but is not a sufficient treatment.
