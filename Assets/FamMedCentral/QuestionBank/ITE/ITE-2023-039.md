# Question ITE-2023-039

A 55-year-old male sees you for a health maintenance examination. He tells you that his father had a myocardial infarction at age 55 and asks you how he can reduce his risk for coronary artery disease. He exercises regularly and does not smoke. His vital signs include a blood pressure of 128/78 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 75 beats/min, and a BMI of 28 kg/m2. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which one of the following is needed to calculate this patient’s American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations? 14 16 ---

## Options

**A.** An ankle-brachial index

**B.** A high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level

**C.** A lipid panel

**D.** A coronary artery calcium score

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

A lipid panel provides total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol data, which are two of the components necessary to calculate the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations. Other components required to compute the ASCVD event risk score include race, sex, age, systolic blood pressure level, smoking status, presence of diabetes mellitus, and antihypertension treatment. An ankle-brachial index, a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, and a coronary artery calcium score are not used in the Pooled Cohort Equations to calculate a patient’s 10-year ASCVD event risk.
