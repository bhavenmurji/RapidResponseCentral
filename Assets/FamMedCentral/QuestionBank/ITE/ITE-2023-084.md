# Question ITE-2023-084

A 43-year-old male with hypertension and steatohepatitis sees you for follow-up after being treated for pneumonia and wheezing. On further questioning he reports mild shortness of breath for the past year. He is a former smoker with a 5-pack-year history. An examination is significant for diminished breath sounds diffusely, but no crackles or wheezing. Pulmonary function testing reveals a moderate nonreversible obstructive defect. Which one of the following tests for genetic conditions would be most appropriate to order in this patient?

## Options

**A.** 1-Antitrypsin levels

**B.** Cystic fibrosis gene panel

**C.** Ehlers-Danlos gene panel

**D.** Hemochromatosis HFE

**E.** HLA-B27

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient is a relatively young person with a limited smoking history who has significant COPD, which should prompt consideration of testing for 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Cystic fibrosis primarily causes restrictive lung disease, typically presents in childhood, and is now often included in routine prenatal and newborn screening tests. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic connective tissue disease. Genetic testing is available for rare subtypes, but not the most common hypermobile form. Hemochromatosis can cause cardiac disease but does not typically cause obstructive lung disease. Both 1-antitrypsin and hemochromatosis can cause liver inflammation. HLA-B27 is associated with seronegative spondyloarthropathies rather than COPD.
