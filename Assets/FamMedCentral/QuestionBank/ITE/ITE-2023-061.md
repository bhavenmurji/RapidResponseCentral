# Question ITE-2023-061

A 75-year-old male with long-standing diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, and venous insufficiency presents to your office with bilateral leg heaviness and recent oozing from his left leg. A physical examination reveals venous stasis dermatitis, edema of both legs, and a well-circumscribed 3×4-cm area of superficial ulceration on the left medial shin with a thin layer of purulent exudate overlying a pink base. The surrounding skin has no erythema, warmth, or tenderness. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable bilaterally. In addition to smoking cessation counseling and local wound care, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Options

**A.** An ankle-brachial index

**B.** A medical-grade compression stocking

**C.** A zinc oxide–impregnated Unna boot

**D.** A wound culture specimen

**E.** A skin biopsy of the ulcer

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient’s presentation is typical for a venous ulcer resulting from long-standing venous hypertension. Patients with venous disease may have leg heaviness, pain, and swelling that worsens throughout the day. Common physical manifestations of venous disease include leg edema, varicose veins, and venous stasis dermatitis. Ulcers also may develop, often over a bony prominence in the lower leg, such as the medial malleolus. Venous ulcers are typically shallow with an exudative appearance over a granulating base and well-defined borders. The mainstay treatment of venous ulcers is compression, which may be accomplished through various methods that are often used in combination. Options include elastic sleeves, compression stockings, non-elastic wraps such as Unna boots, and intermittent pneumatic compression. However, when underlying significant peripheral arterial disease is also present, compression therapy may further compromise distal circulation and cause unintentional harm. Therefore, patients with suspected arterial disease should have distal pulses evaluated and ankle-brachial indexes (ABIs) measured prior to starting compression therapy. When noninvasive testing suggests underlying arterial disease, consultation with a vascular surgeon is indicated. This patient has several risk factors for peripheral arterial disease, including an abnormal pedal pulse examination, and therefore should be evaluated further with ABI measurements before treating his ulcer with either a medical-grade compression stocking or an Unna boot. Although ulcers are often colonized with bacteria, antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of infection. This patient does not have symptoms or signs to suggest active infection and a culture swab would have no impact on his present management. Obtaining a biopsy of a skin ulcer may be indicated in the setting of suspected connective tissue disease, vasculitis, or malignancy but is not indicated in this situation.
