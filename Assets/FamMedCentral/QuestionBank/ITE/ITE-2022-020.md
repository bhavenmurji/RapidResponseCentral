# Question ITE-2022-020

responded well to occasional as-needed use of ibuprofen but have recently worsened in severity and frequency. He is interested in trying an abortive therapy. Triptan use would be CONTRAINDICATED with a history of which one of the following in this patient?

## Options

**A.** Coronary artery stent placement

**B.** Depression with psychotic features

**C.** Diabetes mellitus with a hemoglobin A1c ï‚³7.5%

**D.** Hypertension requiring two medications to achieve control

**E.** Stage 4 chronic kidney disease

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Because of their vasoconstricting properties, triptan medications are contraindicated in patients with
established coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease; patients with
uncontrolled or multiple cardiovascular risk factors; and patients with certain high-risk migraine
syndromes, including basilar and hemiplegic migraines. Triptan use for the treatment of migraine
headaches would not be contraindicated with a history of depression with psychotic features, poorly
controlled diabetes mellitus, hypertension requiring two medications, or stage 4 chronic kidney disease.
