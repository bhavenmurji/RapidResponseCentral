# Question ITE-2024-103

## Question
A 68 -year-old male presents for his annual Medicare wellness visit. A routine alcohol screen finds 
that he consumes 2 drinks every night, but twice per month he consumes 5 or more drinks. However, 
the screening does not reveal symptoms of alcohol use disorder.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate clinical response to address his alcohol 
use?

## Answer Choices
**A)** No intervention
**B)** A brief counseling intervention
**C)** Disulfiram
**D)** Naltrexone
**E)** Referral for cognitive behavioral therapy

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
This patient drinks more than the recommended amount of alcohol and is at increased risk for associated adverse clinical outcomes such as atrial fibrillation, disordered sleep, and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. A brief counseling intervention is recommended and has been consistently shown to decrease alcohol consumption in adults. Medical therapy or a referral to a mental health specialist can be very helpful steps in further treatment once a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder has been established and the patient has shown readiness and motivation to change.
