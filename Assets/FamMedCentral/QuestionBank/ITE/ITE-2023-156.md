# Question ITE-2023-156

An 8-year-old female is brought to your office by her parents for follow-up 6 months after you recommended a DASH diet and 1 hour of physical play daily to address her BMI and blood pressure, which were both greater than the 95th percentile for her age and height. Her mother also has a history of obesity and hypertension. The patient otherwise has an unremarkable past medical history. Although she has lost 1.4 kg (3 lb) her blood pressure remains at 125/77 mm Hg. You diagnose stage 1 hypertension and recommend management with medication. In addition to a CBC; electrolyte, BUN, and creatinine levels; a urinalysis; and a lipid panel, you recommend

## Options

**A.** no further testing

**B.** serum or urine catecholamine measurement

**C.** renal Doppler ultrasonography

**D.** CT angiography of the kidneys

**E.** echocardiography

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Echocardiography should be performed to assess for cardiac target end-organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, when medication is being considered in children with hypertension. Evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension is not needed in children >6 years of age with stage 1 hypertension if they are overweight or have a positive family history of hypertension and there are no physical examination findings indicative of a secondary cause. Renal imaging, catecholamine and steroid levels, and renin activity are indicated in children <6 years of age or patients with stage 2 hypertension ( 95th percentile plus 12 mm Hg systolic or diastolic blood pressure or 140/90 mm Hg, whichever is lower).
