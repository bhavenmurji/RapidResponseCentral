# Question ITE-2022-083

a prescription for an assistive mobility device. The neuropathy has caused poor balance and the knee pain has made walking more painful. As a result her physical endurance has declined over the last several months. Which one of the following assistive devices would be most appropriate for this patient?

## Options

**A.** A cane

**B.** Crutches

**C.** A walker

**D.** A wheelchair

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

A walker would be the most appropriate assistive device for this patient given her balance limitations and
bilateral extremity pain. Canes are most effective for unilateral lower extremity limitations and should be
held in the hand opposite the affected leg and advanced simultaneously with the affected leg. Using a cane
also requires good balance and dexterity, which are limited in this patient. Crutches require significant
upper body strength, balance, and increased energy expenditure, which makes their use impractical in
many older adults. Wheelchairs are generally the last option, as patients who can walk should do so to
maintain function and avoid deconditioning. Referral to a physical therapist can be helpful to determine
the most appropriate assistive device.
