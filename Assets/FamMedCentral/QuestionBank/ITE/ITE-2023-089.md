# Question ITE-2023-089

A 70-year-old male with a COPD exacerbation is found to have a sodium level of 127 mEq/L (N 135–145). He is alert and oriented although he is in mild respiratory distress. After an appropriate evaluation, you determine that he has euvolemic hyponatremia from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), due to his worsening lung disease. Aside from addressing his COPD, which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for his hyponatremia?

## Options

**A.** Fluid restriction

**B.** Salt restriction

**C.** Hypertonic saline

**D.** Furosemide (Lasix)

**E.** Tolvaptan (Samsca)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The treatment for euvolemic hyponatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and restricting fluid intake. A fluid restriction of 500 mL less than the daily urine output is a reasonable goal, although adherence can be difficult. The intake of salt as well as protein should not be restricted. The use of hypertonic saline is restricted to cases of severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Diuretics such as furosemide factor into managing hypervolemic hyponatremia but not euvolemic hyponatremia. Vaptans such as tolvaptan are vasopressin receptor antagonists that may be considered for short-term use in addition to fluid restriction for select cases of severe asymptomatic hyponatremia, defined as a sodium level <125 mEq/L. 35
