# Question ITE-2022-066

due to locally advanced pancreatic cancer. He is started on intravenous fluids and morphine, along with a prophylactic dose of subcutaneous heparin. Shortly after admission he develops right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. His vital signs are normal, except for a respiratory rate of 24/min. An abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the epigastric area. An examination of the heart and lungs is normal. There is no calf tenderness or leg edema. An EKG shows new right bundle branch block. Which one of the following tests should you order next?

## Options

**A.** A D-dimer level

**B.** A troponin level

**C.** Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities

**D.** A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan

**E.** Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patientâ€™s pretest probability for pulmonary embolism is high given his multiple risk factors, signs, and
symptoms. The presence of a new onset of right bundle branch block in a patient presenting with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath and chest pain, especially in the setting of active cancer, should raise suspicion
of pulmonary embolism. Other EKG abnormalities include tachycardia or bradycardia, an S1Q3T3 pattern,
atrial fibrillation, and T-wave inversions in the anterior leads. Patients with cancers of the pancreas and
stomach have the highest risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and should receive
pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis during hospitalizations.
In the absence of renal failure, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the most
appropriate diagnostic study and would be preferred over a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. A D-dimer
level has a high negative predictive value in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism; however, it has low
specificity, and...
