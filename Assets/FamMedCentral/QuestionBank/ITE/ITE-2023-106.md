# Question ITE-2023-106

A 19-year-old male presents with a 3-day history of fever, fatigue, and sore throat. He states that his girlfriend has been experiencing similar symptoms for the past couple of weeks. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), a heart rate of 92 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 18/min. On examination you note tonsillar erythema, palatal petechiae, and anterior and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. An abdominal examination reveals splenomegaly. A rapid streptococcal test is negative and a heterophile antibody test is positive. A CBC with differential demonstrates atypical lymphocytes. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient’s condition?

## Options

**A.** Amoxicillin

**B.** Dexamethasone

**C.** Foscarnet (Foscavir)

**D.** Ibuprofen

**E.** Valacyclovir (Valtrex)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Supportive therapy including medication, adequate hydration, and rest is the standard of care for the treatment of infectious mononucleosis. For example, ibuprofen is recommended as an antipyretic and an analgesic. Since streptococcal pharyngitis is most common in ages 5–15 and this patient’s rapid streptococcal test is negative, it is highly unlikely as a concomitant diagnosis. Thus, amoxicillin therapy would not be appropriate. Though Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are the etiology of infectious mononucleosis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antivirals (including foscarnet or valacyclovir) or corticosteroids for the treatment of infectious mononucleosis.
