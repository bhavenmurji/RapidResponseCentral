# Question ITE-2024-071

## Question
You see a 45 -year-old male with a history of opioid use disorder for a health maintenance 
examination. The patient has successfully remained in a treatment program using methadone, and an 
examination is normal. He has not had a recent EKG.  
 You order an EK G because which one of the following is a very rare but serious complication of 
methadone treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
**B)** QTc prolongation
**C)** First-degree heart block
**D)** Second -degree Mobitz type II heart block
**E)** Complete heart block

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
QTc prolongation is a very rare but serious complication of methadone treatment. Expert organizations recommend obtaining a baseline EKG in patients with other risk factors. Although the optimal strategy for patients with a QTc interval â‰¥500 milliseconds is debated, physicians should review risks and discuss alternatives to other QTc prolongation medications. If the risk of continuing methadone outweighs the high -risk potential for opioid overdose with methadone discontinuation, alternatives to methadone ca n be pursued.
