# Question ITE-2022-118

effects of antidepressants, which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Amitriptyline

**B.** Duloxetine (Cymbalta)

**C.** Nortriptyline (Pamelor)

**D.** Sertraline (Zoloft)

**E.** Venlafaxine (Effexor XR)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A recent review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found the frequency of
adverse events in older adults taking SSRIs such as sertraline and escitalopram was similar to placebo (SOR
B). SSRIs also have lower discontinuation rates than tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline or
nortriptyline during treatment of up to 12 weeks (SOR B).
evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) suggests that SNRIs including duloxetine and venlafaxine cause more adverse events and greater
discontinuation of therapy during treatment of up to 12 weeks when compared to placebo (SOR B). A
randomized, controlled trial involving duloxetine demonstrated an increased risk of treatment withdrawal
due to adverse events and an increased risk of falls over 12â€“24 weeks.
Venlafaxine was compared to no antidepressant use in a large cohort study that had a median treatment
period of 364 days and was associated with an increased risk of falls, fractures, and mortality.
