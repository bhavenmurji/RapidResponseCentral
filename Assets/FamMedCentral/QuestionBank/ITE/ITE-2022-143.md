# Question ITE-2022-143

and fifth fingers for the last several weeks. He has had some generalized weakness in his hands, noting that it is more difficult for him to grasp and pick up small objects with his thumb and forefinger. There is no history of trauma. He is very physically active and lifts weights 5â€“6 days per week. On physical examination you note weakness of the pincer mechanism and decreased sensation over the hypothenar eminence and fourth and fifth fingers. These findings are associated with peripheral entrapment of which one of the following nerves?

## Options

**A.** Axillary

**B.** Median

**C.** Radial

**D.** Suprascapular

**E.** Ulnar

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient has entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the wrist level. This is more common in activities that
place pressure on the volar aspect of the wrist, including weightlifting and cycling. Classic symptoms
include paresthesia of the fourth and fifth fingers and hypothenar eminence, weakness in finger adduction
and abduction, and weakness of the pincer mechanism. Axillary nerve entrapment can result from shoulder
dislocations, humeral neck fracture, and pressure from crutch use, and can cause decreased sensation or
pain over the lateral shoulder as well as weakness with shoulder external rotation, abduction, and
extension. Median nerve entrapment results in paresthesia of the first three fingers and can result in thenar
muscle atrophy. The radial nerve can be entrapped or compressed at many different locations, most
commonly due to sustained pressure over the radial groove. This will result in paresthesia and pain in the
posterior forearm and dorsal hand as well as weakness in wrist ...
