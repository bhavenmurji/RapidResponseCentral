# Question ITE-2023-054

A 48-year-old female presents to your office because of painful sexual intercourse occurring with both initial entry and deep penetration. She has been using lubricants, but still experiences burning and dryness. Her last menstrual period was 1 year ago. A pelvic examination reveals slightly pale vaginal mucosa. Which one of the following would be the best and most cost-effective initial therapy?

## Options

**A.** Vaginal estradiol cream (Estrace Vaginal)

**B.** Vaginal prasterone (Intrarosa)

**C.** Ospemifene (Osphena)

**D.** OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)

**E.** Pelvic floor physical therapy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Dyspareunia is common in menopausal women and may be caused by vaginal atrophy that results in burning and dryness. Pain is generally caused by entry and deep penetration. An examination may show pale and dry vaginal mucosa, although this may appear normal in early menopause. It may be treated with vaginal moisturizers or lubricants, but further treatment may be needed. Topical estrogen is the most effective initial therapy and is much more cost-effective than other alternatives. For patients with a preference for non-estrogen treatment, ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. However, it costs more than $200 per month and should not be used if there is a history of thromboembolism. A vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone formulation called prasterone decreases pain by increasing epithelial thickness, but also costs over $200 monthly. OnabotulinumtoxinA and pelvic floor physical therapy are utilized when pelvic floor dysfunction is the cause of dyspareunia.
