# Question ITE-2023-097

A 47-year-old male presents to your office concerned about his “ugly” toenails. On examination you note that all of his toenails are discolored, thickened, and brittle. He was evaluated by a dermatologist and has been using topical ciclopirox 8% for 7 months. He does not recall any allergies to any medications. After confirming your suspected diagnosis with a sample from the affected toenails, which one of the following would be the most appropriate oral pharmacotherapy?

## Options

**A.** Fluconazole (Diflucan)

**B.** Griseofulvin

**C.** Pulse dosing with itraconazole (Sporanox)

**D.** Continuous itraconazole

**E.** Terbinafine

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Onychomycosis, a chronic fungal infection affecting the toenail and fingernail beds, leads to discolored, brittle, and thickened nails. This is not just a cosmetic problem, but can cause discomfort, pain, and physical impairment affecting the quality of life. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis prior to initiating treatment is important to avoid adverse effects caused by lengthy treatment. Dermatophytes are the cause of 70% of onychomycosis. Risk factors include age older than 60; trauma; tobacco use; and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, HIV, malignancy, and obesity. Onychomycosis is classified into several subtypes based on nail invasion. Treatment includes topical and oral options. Terbinafine is the most effective oral agent for this patient who did not benefit from topical therapy and has all toenails affected. Fluconazole may be used off-label as an alternative or if a patient cannot tolerate terbinafine. Griseofulvin is rarely used due to its long treatment duration, lower cure rates, and higher risk of adverse reactions. A pulse-dosing regimen of itraconazole is used for the treatment of fingernails. Continuous itraconazole has a higher relapse rate than terbinafine.
