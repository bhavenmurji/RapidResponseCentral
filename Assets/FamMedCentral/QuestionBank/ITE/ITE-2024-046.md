# Question ITE-2024-046

## Question
A 32 -year-old female presents with concerns regarding infertility. She has been married for 3 years 
and has been attempting to conceive for the past 18 months. She reports early menarche at age 10 and 
a long -standing history of dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding. These symptoms improved when she 
was using oral contraceptive therapy in her 20s. Transvaginal ultrasou nd results are inconclusive.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A 6-month trial of oral contraceptive therapy
**B)** A trial of aromatase inhibitor therapy such as letrozole (Femara)
**C)** Placement of a levonorgestrel -releasing IUD (Mirena)
**D)** Diagnostic laparoscopic surgery to confirm the diagnosis

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
There is a high suspicion for endometriosis in this patient who desires pregnancy. She has classic symptoms, including painful menses and early menarche, and she is now experiencing infertility. Her symptoms improved with oral contraceptive treatment in th e past. Laparoscopic surgery can assist with both diagnosis and treatment. Given that the patient desires pregnancy, a trial of oral contraceptive therapy and placement of a levonorgestrel -releasing IUD are not appropriate. While aromatase inhibitor therap y such as letrozole may be considered in the future, a complete infertility workup, including evaluation for male factor infertility, should be completed first.
