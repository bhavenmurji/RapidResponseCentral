# Question ITE-2023-135

A 42-year-old male presents with a 2-day history of right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and anorexia. His medical history is remarkable for hypertension treated with lisinopril (Zestril), type 2 diabetes managed without medication, microalbuminuria, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 48 mL/min/1.73 m2. He has not had any previous surgeries. An examination is remarkable for tenderness in the right lower quadrant. You order a CBC, urinalysis, and metabolic panel. To complete the initial workup, which one of the following would be the most appropriate imaging modality in this situation? 51 53 ---

## Options

**A.** Ultrasonography

**B.** CT without contrast

**C.** CT with oral contrast

**D.** CT with intravenous contrast

**E.** MRI with intravenous contrast

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The preferred imaging for suspected appendicitis in an adult is CT with intravenous (IV) contrast (SOR C). While there is concern about the use of IV contrast in patients with chronic kidney disease, studies have shown that there is no significant increase in the risk for acute kidney injury with the use of IV contrast in patients with or without pre-existing renal dysfunction (SOR B). IV contrast is considered safe in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Pretreating patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 with isotonic crystalloid volume expansion is recommended. Oral contrast has not been shown to increase the sensitivity or specificity of CT in the evaluation of appendicitis. Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality for children with suspected appendicitis, but not adults. MRI is not recommended for the evaluation of appendicitis.
