# Question ITE-2022-196

following would be the most appropriate first-line treatment?

## Options

**A.** Dietary modification

**B.** Vitamin supplementation

**C.** Behavioral intervention

**D.** Atomoxetine (Strattera)

**E.** Methylphenidate (Ritalin)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in preschool children aged 4â€“5 years should be managed initially
with behavioral intervention. Starting at age 6, pharmacologic medication such as atomoxetine or
methylphenidate could be considered. There is no evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of any benefit with dietary modification or
vitamin supplementation.
