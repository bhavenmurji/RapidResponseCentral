# Question ITE-2023-195

A 52-year-old postmenopausal female presents for evaluation of a lump on her neck. Other than a palpable thyroid nodule measuring approximately 1 cm, a history and physical examination are unremarkable. Based on this finding, which one of the following additional evaluations is indicated at this time?

## Options

**A.** TSH, T3, and free T4 levels, and an antithyroid antibodies assay

**B.** A TSH level and thyroid ultrasonography

**C.** A TSH level and neck CT

**D.** A TSH level, thyroid ultrasonography, and neck CT

**E.** A TSH level and a radionucleotide thyroid uptake scan

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The primary objective of evaluating a thyroid nodule is to determine malignancy. The next step after a history and physical examination is to order a serum TSH level and thyroid ultrasonography. Further biochemical analysis beyond a TSH level, including measuring total T3 and free T4 levels along with testing for antithyroid antibodies, may assist with the evaluation of suspected thyroiditis but does not impact the diagnostic workup for a thyroid nodule. CT imaging is useful for evaluating other masses in the head and neck region, although it does not factor into the diagnostic algorithm for an isolated thyroid nodule. A radionucleotide uptake scan is indicated when the TSH level is low to discern whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (hot) or nonfunctioning (cold). A hyperfunctioning nodule is much less likely to be malignant and does not require cell or tissue sampling. If the TSH level is normal or high, an uptake scan is not indicated. In such cases, as well as when an uptake scan reveals a nonfunctioning nodule, the malignancy potential is stratified based on the noduleâ€™s size and characteristics on ultrasonography. Higher-risk nodules require fine-needle aspiration, while lower-risk nodules may be monitored with follow-up ultrasonography.
