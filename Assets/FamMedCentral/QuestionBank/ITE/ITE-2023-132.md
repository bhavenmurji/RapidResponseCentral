# Question ITE-2023-132

A 57-year-old male sees you for follow-up of a first episode of a distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently taking apixaban (Eliquis) and has had no complications. He has no past medical history, including surgery or hospitalization, and he has not traveled recently. His vital signs today include a heart rate of 70 beats/min and a blood pressure of 118/76 mm Hg. His BMI is 32 kg/m2. A physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate duration of treatment for an unprovoked first DVT? 49 51 --- 50 52 ---

## Options

**A.** No treatment

**B.** 6 weeks

**C.** 3 months

**D.** 6 months

**E.** Indefinite

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common occurrence and is the cause of up to 100,000 deaths per year in the United States. When determining a course of treatment, it is key to identify whether the VTE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was caused by a temporary or transient risk factor. Common transient risk factors include surgery, hospitalization, trauma, and prolonged travel. VTE in the setting of a transient risk factor should be treated with anticoagulation for 3 months. In this patientâ€™s case, there is no obvious transient risk factor. However, obesity and male sex may be considered chronic or persistent risk factors. In this setting, the rate of recurrence in the first year is as high as 10.3%. NICE and CHEST guidelines recommend an indefinite duration of treatment for VTE that is due to chronic risk factors or VTE that is otherwise unprovoked (SOR C). Risk factors for bleeding should prompt consideration to discontinue treatment. While guidelines include the option for serial ultrasonographic monitoring of distal DVT without anticoagulation, this course of action is not recommended in patients with unprovoked DVT. Neither 6 weeks nor 6 months are established treatment durations.
