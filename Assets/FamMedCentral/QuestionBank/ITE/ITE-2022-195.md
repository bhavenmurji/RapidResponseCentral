# Question ITE-2022-195

cortisol level is low. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate confirmatory test?

## Options

**A.** A 21-hydroxylase antibody level

**B.** An ACTH stimulation test

**C.** A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test

**D.** A high-dose dexamethasone suppression test

**E.** CT of the adrenal glands

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

An ACTH stimulation test is the most appropriate confirmatory test for suspected adrenal insufficiency.
If a cortisol level drawn 1 or 2 hours after administration of ACTH is inappropriately low, adrenal
insufficiency is confirmed, and further evaluation is indicated to determine the etiology. A 21-hydroxylase
antibody level may indicate that adrenal insufficiency has an autoimmune cause but does not confirm the
presence of adrenal insufficiency. Dexamethasone suppression tests, in which morning cortisol is tested
after administration of dexamethasone the previous evening, are used in the evaluation of suspected
Cushing syndrome. Inappropriately elevated cortisol levels are indicative of Cushing syndrome. Imaging
might be useful in determining the cause of adrenal gland dysfunction once adrenal insufficiency is
confirmed.
