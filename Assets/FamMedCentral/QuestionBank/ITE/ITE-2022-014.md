# Question ITE-2022-014

sarcoidosis?

## Options

**A.** Bilateral hilar adenopathy

**B.** Caseating granulomas

**C.** Pleural granulomas

**D.** Peribronchiolar thickening

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect many organ systems, but 90% of patients have
pulmonary involvement. While many patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis are asymptomatic, pulmonary
symptoms including dry cough, the gradual onset of dyspnea, and fatigue are nonspecific, and the
condition is often not suspected until chest radiography is performed. The most common finding is bilateral
hilar adenopathy alone (stage 1). Other findings, which usually develop over time, include infiltrates and,
in some patients, ultimately fibrosis. The classic pathologic findings from biopsies are noncaseating
granulomas. Caseating granulomas are indicative of tuberculosis. Pleural involvement is not typical in
sarcoidosis. Peribronchiolar or peritracheal thickening and interstitial infiltrates may be seen on CT scans,
but bilateral hilar adenopathy is the most characteristic finding in earlier pulmonary sarcoidosis and is
readily seen on plain chest radiographs.
