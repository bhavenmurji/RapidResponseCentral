# Question ITE-2022-185

with urination or visible change in her urine. Her past medical history includes hysterectomy for fibroids. Further history reveals no concerning environmental exposures other than a 5-pack-year history of smoking in her twenties. A physical examination, including a pelvic examination, is unremarkable. A urine dipstick reveals only 1+ RBCs. A microscopic urinalysis is negative with the exception of 7 RBCs/hpf, and a urine culture is negative. Which one of the following would you recommend at this point?

## Options

**A.** Repeat urinalysis in 6 months

**B.** Renal ultrasonography only

**C.** Urine cytology and renal ultrasonography

**D.** Urine cytology and CT urography

**E.** Cystoscopy and CT urography

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with microscopic hematuria without a clear cause. Past guidelines from the American
Urologic Association recommended cystoscopy and CT urography for all patients over the age of 35 with
microscopic hematuria. However, current guidelines recommend risk stratification and emphasize the use
of imaging that has less radiation exposure. Because she is female and younger than 50 years of age, this
patient is at low risk of urologic malignancy. Her smoking history and RBC count of <10 RBCs/hpf are
also considered low risk. The guidelines recommend the option of repeating urinalysis in 6 months before
proceeding with imaging or procedures, given her low risk (SOR C). Renal ultrasonography may be used
in intermediate-risk patients, while CT urography is reserved for high-risk patients. Urine cytology is not
a recommended test in this setting.
