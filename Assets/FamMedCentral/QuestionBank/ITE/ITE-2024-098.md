# Question ITE-2024-098

## Question
A 72 -year-old female presents with pain in her right foot after missing a step while descending a 
staircase. She was leading with her right foot when she stumbled. On examination she has tenderness 
in the right dorsal and plantar midfoot. Foot x- rays are normal. An image of the right plantar foot is 
shown below.  
Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Non–weight bearing status, plus CT or MRI
**B)** Corticosteroid injection
**C)** Heel splints and physical therapy
**D)** Rigid ankle support and physical therapy
**E)** Rigid ankle support and referral to an orthopedic surgeon

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient has a Lisfranc injury of the right midfoot. Lisfranc injuries occur to the tarsometatarsal joint complex of the foot, which is stabilized by a complex ligamentous structure. Injuries can range from simple subluxations to complex fractures with dislocations. Falling forward on a plantar -flexed foot, such as when missing a stair step, is a common mechanism of injury. Forced dorsiflexion, which often occurs in sports or motor vehicle collisions, is another common mechanism. Missed Lisfranc injurie s can lead to instability, deformity, and painful chronic osteoarthritis of the midfoot. X-rays are the first step in diagnosis but have a sensitivity of around 84%. Plantar bruising is a classic sign and should trigger a high index of suspicion for Lisfranc injury even with negative plain or weight -bearing x -rays, and CT or MRI should be orde red. If a Lisfranc injury is seen on imaging or is highly suspected, the patient should remain non–weight bearing. Depending on the severity of the injury, referral to an orthopedic surgeon may be warranted after definitive imaging. Corticosteroid injectio n, heel splints, rigid ankle support, and physical therapy are not appropriate at this time.
