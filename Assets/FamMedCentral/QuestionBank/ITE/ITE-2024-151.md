# Question ITE-2024-151

## Question
A 63 -year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus presents to an urgent care clinic with 
nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. His spouse reports that the patient began having trouble 
breathing during the short drive to the clinic. He has an insulin pump, and his spouse says it has been 
malfunctioning. On examination the patient is lethargic, tachycardic, and appears volume depleted. 
You note Kussmaul respirations and abdominal tenderness. After initiating intravenous fluids, you 
obtain  an initial laboratory evaluation with the following results: 
Glucose  190 mg/dL   
Sodium   135 mEq/L (N 135 –145)  
Potassium   5.1 mEq/L (N 3.5 –5.2)  
Chloride   102 mEq/L (N 98 –107)  
Creatinine   1.30 mg/dL (N 0.50 –1.04)   
Osmolality   300 mOsm/kg H 2O (N 280–305)  
Bicarbonate   10 mEq/L (N 19 –29)  
Anion gap   23 mEq/L (N <18)   
Urine ketones   4+  
Urine glucose   4+  
Which one of the following medications may be contributing to this clinical picture?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Atorvastatin (Lipitor)
**B)** Canagliflozin (Invokana)
**C)** Lisinopril (Zestril)
**D)** Metformin
**E)** Semaglutide (Ozempic)

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
This patient has classic symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) triggered by a malfunctioning insulin pump, but he appears euglycemic on presentation due to taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. Glycosuria occurs and can even persist 10 –14 days after discontinuation of an SGLT2 inhibitor. Further evaluation of this patient would reveal an elevated urine glucose level despite his relatively normal serum glucose level. With a high anion gap, a low arterial pH and a high serum β-hydroxybutyrate level should also be expe cted. Atorvastatin is not implicated in acute metabolic problems. Lisinopril can cause hyperkalemia, but not DKA. Metformin can cause lactic acidosis in acutely ill patients, but the risk is low and lactic acid rather than ketone bodies would be high. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide are not associated with an increased risk for euglycemic DKA.
