# Question ITE-2024-009

## Question
A 65 -year-old female is found to have a T -score of –3.3 on a DEXA scan that is performed as part of 
her Welcome to Medicare evaluation. She has a 30 -pack -year smoking history but quit smoking 5 
years ago. An examination reveals a thin female but is otherwise unremarkable. A CBC, a 
comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid studies are unremarkable. X -rays reveal evidence of an 
old compression fracture of the thoracic spine.  
 
Which one of the following would be  the most appropriate initial treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Oral alendronate (Fosamax)
**B)** Oral raloxifene (Evista)
**C)** Subcutaneous denosumab (Prolia)
**D)** Subcutaneous teriparatide (Forteo)
**E)** Intravenous zoledronic acid (Reclast)

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made with a prior fracture of the hip or spine, or a T-score ≤ –2.5. A FRAX score ≥3% for hip fracture or ≥20% for major osteoporotic fracture is also diagnostic. The usual first -line treatment is an oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate or intravenous zoledronic acid. Denosumab would be preferred if the creatinine clearance were less than 30 –35 mL/min/1.73 m ². Patients such as this one would be considered at very high fracture risk. Diagnostic criteria for this risk category include a T -score < –3.0, a FRAX score ≥4.5% for hip fracture or ≥30% for major osteoporotic fracture, multiple fractures, fracture within 1 2 months, or fracture during treatment for osteoporosis. The initial treatment recommendation would be a parathyroid hormone analogue such as teriparatide daily for 2 years. Raloxifene is indicated for the prevention of vertebral fractures only. It is useful in patients with a history of breast cancer to help decrease the risk for recurrence.
