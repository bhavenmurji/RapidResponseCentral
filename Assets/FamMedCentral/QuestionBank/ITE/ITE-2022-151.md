# Question ITE-2022-151

has not had any falls or other injuries and estimates that she runs 40 miles per week. Menarche occurred at age 12 but over the past year her periods have become irregular, with her last menses occurring about 4 months prior to presentation. She is not sexually active and a urine pregnancy test is negative. She and her parents tell you that she eats a healthy diet, although she does report an inadvertent weight loss of 15 lb as she has increased her running mileage over the past year. She takes a multivitamin and occasional acetaminophen for pain but does not take any chronic medications. A physical examination reveals a thin female who does not show any signs of acute distress. Her vital signs include a weight of 52 kg (115 lb), a height of 173 cm (68 in), a BMI of 18 kg/m2, a heart rate of 50 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 85/44 mm Hg. Which one of the following is the most likely underlying cause of her condition?

## Options

**A.** Anemia

**B.** Anorexia nervosa

**C.** Low circulating estrogen levels

**D.** Low energy availability relative to needs

**E.** Vitamin D deficiency

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient has the female athlete triad, a syndrome characterized by low energy availability relative to
needs, disordered menses (delayed menarche, oligomenorrhea, or secondary amenorrhea), and decreased
bone mineral density. This patient exhibits at least two components of the triad, although only one is
required for diagnosis. Low energy availability relative to needs can be related to an eating disorder or to
exercising beyond caloric supply. This leads to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, which results in low
circulating estrogen levels and then reduced bone mineral density. Anemia would be secondary to the low
energy availability rather than the cause of this spectrum of issues. This patient does not have a history
consistent with anorexia nervosa. Vitamin D deficiency would not cause the menstrual irregularities she
has noted.
