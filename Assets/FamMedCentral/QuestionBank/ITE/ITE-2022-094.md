# Question ITE-2022-094

has been admitted to the hospital. You note that this is his third hospital admission over the last 4 months, due to a variety of acute medical concerns. His medical history includes heart failure, mild dementia, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes. You consider transitions of care planning for this patient upon discharge. Which one of the following interventions would offer the best efficacy for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Rapid medication reconciliation, a home visit, and follow-up with you within 7 days of

**B.** Rapid medication reconciliation, a home visit, and follow-up with his endocrinologist

**C.** Rapid post-discharge laboratory studies, and follow-up with his cardiologist within 7

**D.** Rapid post-discharge laboratory studies, and follow-up with both you and his

**E.** Rapid medication reconciliation, rapid post-discharge laboratory studies, and follow-up

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Given this patientâ€™s substantial burden of multimorbidity as well as ongoing patterns of high acute care
utilization, he is at very high risk for readmission upon discharge. Although there has been significant
heterogeneity across interventions over the last decade in optimizing transitions of care for high-risk
patients, many analyses, including systematic reviews, have identified medication reconciliation and close
follow-up with a primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) care physician to be among the components critical to success, along with a home
visit from either a nursing team member or a licensed independent practitioner. There is no clear evidence
that rapid post-discharge laboratory studies improve outcomes. While there may be a tendency to focus
on disease-specific interventions via specialty care, the preponderance of evidence supports a holistic focus

discharge are also key components valued by patien...
