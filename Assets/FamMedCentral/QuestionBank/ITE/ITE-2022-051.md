# Question ITE-2022-051

is concerned because sewing has been more difficult over the past 6 months. She recalls that her motherâ€™s hands were misshapen, but her mother never received a diagnosis. You examine her hands, which are shown below. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

## Options

**A.** Colchicine (Colcrys)

**B.** Diclofenac (Zorvolex)

**C.** Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)

**D.** Infliximab (Remicade) injections

**E.** Methotrexate (Trexall)

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient presents with erosive osteoarthritis that involves the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints with sparing of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. The primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) goals for
treating osteoarthritis are to control symptoms such as pain and stiffness and optimize function in order
to preserve quality of life. Topical or oral NSAIDs are the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for
osteoarthritis of the hand. Colchicine and methotrexate have not been studied for the treatment of
osteoarthritis and their use for this condition is not recommended. Colchicine is indicated for the treatment
of gout, which is usually pauciarticular and asymmetrical, and methotrexate is effective for rheumatoid
arthritis. Conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying medications such as hydroxychloroquine
and infliximab have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. These medications
are appropriate for the treatment of systemic lupus erythema...
