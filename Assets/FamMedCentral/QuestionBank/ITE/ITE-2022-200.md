# Question ITE-2022-200

cough, headache, and myalgias. A nasal swab confirms influenza B. Which one of the following is the preferred antiviral treatment for this patient?

## Options

**A.** No treatment because of her pregnancy

**B.** No treatment because antiviral medication is indicated for influenza A but not influenza

**C.** Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)

**D.** Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)

**E.** Peramivir (Rapivab)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Antiviral medications are recommended for the treatment of influenza only within 48 hours of symptom
onset (SOR A). However, in high-risk patient populations and in severe cases of disease, antiviral
medications should be provided regardless of the duration of symptoms (SOR B). According to the CDC,
oseltamivir remains the drug of choice for the treatment of influenza A and B during pregnancy because
it has good safety data. Baloxavir marboxil is indicated for patients >12 years of age but should be
avoided during pregnancy. There is less safety data for peramivir and zanamivir.
