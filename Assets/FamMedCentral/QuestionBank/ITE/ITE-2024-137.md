# Question ITE-2024-137

## Question
Medicaid is the largest health insurance program in the United States based on its number of enrolled 
recipients. Which one of the following statements is true regarding Medicaid?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Fewer than half of all states have participated in the Medicaid expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act
**B)** Its federal funding decreased during the COVID -19 pandemic
**C)** It is the predominant insurer for long -term care
**D)** The racial and ethnic group distribution of Medicaid recipients reflects that of the U.S. population

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Medicaid, a federal program that is managed by individual states, is the predominant insurer for long -term care in the United States. Once older adults have exhausted their resources for long -term care, they can enroll in Medicaid. Sixty -two percent of nur sing home residents are funded through Medicaid. As of 2022, 24% of all Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and almost 70% of enrollees participate in managed care programs. Medicaid is a “countercyclical” program, meaning that as the economy worsens, enrollment increases. The federal government committed a 6.2% funding increase to states during the height of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded Medi caid coverage to a higher percentage of adults, with the federal government initially funding the expansion. As of 2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia had adopted the Medicaid expansion. The majority of Medicaid recipients (56%) are from racial an d ethnic minorities, reflecting income inequality in the United States.
