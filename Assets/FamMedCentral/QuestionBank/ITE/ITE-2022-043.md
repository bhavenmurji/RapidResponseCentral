# Question ITE-2022-043

hypoglycemia?

## Options

**A.** Biguanides

**B.** DPP-4 inhibitors

**C.** SGLT2 inhibitors

**D.** Sulfonylureas

**E.** Thiazolidinediones

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Multiple classes of diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) medications are used to address the pathways that lead to hyperglycemia, and
it is important to select medication classes that reduce the risk of hypoglycemia while improving long-term
outcomes. Hypoglycemia is associated with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Sulfonylureas,
such as glipizide, glyburide, and glimepiride, commonly cause hypoglycemia as an adverse effect and
require glucose monitoring when used. Biguanides most commonly cause diarrhea, vomiting, and other
gastrointestinal symptoms. In high-risk patients such as those with heart failure, sepsis, or impaired kidney
function, biguanides can also result in lactic acidosis. The only biguanide currently available is metformin.
The most common adverse effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, which include saxagliptin, sitagliptin, linagliptin,
alogliptin, are headache, nasopharyngitis, infections of the urinary tract or upper respiratory tract, and
elevated liver enzymes. SGLT2 inhibitors, such as...
