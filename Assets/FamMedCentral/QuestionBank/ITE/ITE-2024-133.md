# Question ITE-2024-133

## Question
A 27 -year-old comatose female is brought to the emergency department. There is no history of 
trauma. 
 
An overdose of which one of the following would most likely account for a decreased respiratory rate 
of 10/min?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Anticonvulsants
**B)** Antipsychotics
**C)** Ethanol
**D)** Opioids
**E)** Sedative -hypnotics

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
The classic toxidrome of apnea, stupor, and miosis is indicative of opioid overdose. Not all of these findings are always present. In a patient not physiologically sleeping, a respiratory rate â‰¤12/min is strongly suggestive of opioid toxicity. Respiratory depression is not usually found with overdose from anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, ethanol, or sedative -hypnotic agents.
