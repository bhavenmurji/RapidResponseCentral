# Question ITE-2022-193

liver disease?

## Options

**A.** No routine screening for any patients

**B.** Routine screening for patients with obesity

**C.** Routine screening for patients with hypothyroidism

**D.** Routine screening for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome

**E.** Routine screening for patients with type 2 diabetes

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Routine screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not recommended for any patients, even
those considered to be at high risk. The highest risk factor for NAFLD is obesity, and other risk factors
include type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. There is emerging evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) that HIV, hypothyroidism,
polycystic ovary syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and genetic variation of the PNPLA3 gene are likely
risk factors as well. NAFLD is usually discovered with the incidental finding of elevated liver enzymes.
An AST/ALT ratio >1.5 is suspicious for excessive alcohol use, while a ratio of ï‚£0.8 is more likely due
to NAFLD.
If NAFLD is suspected, the first step is to obtain a detailed history, particularly for hepatotoxic
medications and alcohol use. Drugs that can be problematic include chemotherapy medications,
amiodarone, aspirin, corticosteroids, cocaine, NSAIDs, tetracyclines, and valproic acid. The next step is
to evaluate for hepatitis B and C infection and measure ferritin a...
