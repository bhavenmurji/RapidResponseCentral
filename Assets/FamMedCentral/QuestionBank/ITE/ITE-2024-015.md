# Question ITE-2024-015

## Question
A 35 -year-old female presents for evaluation of bilateral breast pain that varies in intensity with her 
menstrual cycle. She drinks 2 cups of caffeinated coffee per day and does not take any regular medications. Her past medical history is unremarkable and  she does not have any family history of 
breast cancer. A physical examination, including a clinical breast examination, is normal. A urine 
hCG test is negative.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A trial of dietary caffeine elimination
**B)** A trial of topical diclofenac
**C)** Prolactin and TSH levels
**D)** Ultrasonography
**E)** Diagnostic mammography

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Evidence supports the use of topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac for first -line pharmacologic treatment of both cyclic and noncyclic mastalgia (SOR B). Topical NSAIDs are preferred over oral NSAIDs due to lower risk for adverse effects. Although caffeine is commonly cited as a contributing cause of breast pain, randomized, controlled trials have not demonstrated clear evidence that caffeine avoidance reduces pain. Patients with galactorrhea should undergo hormone evaluation with measurement of prolactin and T SH levels, although hormone evaluation is not indicated for patients with breast pain who present without associated nipple discharge. Patients without a palpable mass who present with cyclic breast pain, such as the patient in this scenario, are at low ri sk for breast cancer and do not require imaging.
