# Question ITE-2022-076

He recently immigrated from Uganda. An interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA, QuantiFERON-TB Gold) is positive. He is otherwise healthy. He has not had any cough, fever, unintended weight loss, or night sweats. Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?

## Options

**A.** Tuberculin skin testing

**B.** Inducing sputum for mycobacterial culture

**C.** Chest radiography

**D.** Proceeding with treatment for latent tuberculosis

**E.** Proceeding with treatment for active tuberculosis

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patientâ€™s tuberculosis (TB) screening test is positive, and the next step in the evaluation involves
determining whether he has a latent infection or active disease. Diagnosis of latent TB requires ruling out
active disease by assessing the patient clinically with a history, physical examination, and chest radiograph.
If this evaluation does not suggest active disease, sputum studies are not needed. Interferon-gamma release
assays (IGRA), which are blood tests used to screen for TB infection, are more accurate than tuberculin
skin testing, so a tuberculin skin test is not needed. Treatment should not be started until a determination
of latent versus active TB is made.
