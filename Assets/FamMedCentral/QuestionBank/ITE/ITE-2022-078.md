# Question ITE-2022-078

conditions in primary care. Which one of the following conditions has grade A evidence for treatment with systemic corticosteroids?

## Options

**A.** Acute bronchitis

**B.** Acute pharyngitis

**C.** Acute sinusitis

**D.** Bell’s palsy

**E.** Lumbar radiculopathy

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Although many providers assume short-term systemic corticosteroids are safe, evidence shows multiple
negative effects including elevated blood glucose and blood pressure, mood and sleep disturbance, and an
increased risk of sepsis and venous thromboembolism. There are adequate trials to support the use of
systemic corticosteroids within 3 days of the onset of Bell’s palsy (SOR A). Adequate studies recommend
against prescribing systemic corticosteroids for acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying asthma or
COPD, or acute sinusitis (SOR B). There is insufficient evidence (SOR B) to support the routine use of
systemic corticosteroids for patients with acute pharyngitis or lumbar radiculopathy.
