# Question ITE-2023-126

A 60-year-old female comes to your office several weeks after an emergency department (ED) visit for ureteral colic. At that time, a comprehensive metabolic panel was normal except for a calcium level of 10.6 mg/dL (N 8.6â€“10.5). An ionized calcium level was also elevated. A urinalysis showed 20 RBCs/hpf but a urine culture was negative. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 4-mm radiopaque calculus in the distal ureter but no other abnormality. She was treated with analgesics and tamsulosin (Flomax) and passed the stone several days later. She currently has no urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. This is her third episode of ureterolithiasis in the past 5 years. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate test to order next?

## Options

**A.** An intact parathyroid hormone level

**B.** A 24-hour urine sample for calcium

**C.** A TSH level

**D.** Repeat urinalysis and urine culture

**E.** Renal ultrasonography

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Hyperparathyroidism is an under-recognized cause of recurrent nephrolithiasis. Mild elevations of serum calcium levels are often overlooked or ignored. Surgical treatment of hyperparathyroidism can reduce serum calcium levels, hypercalciuria, and the formation of kidney stones. A 24-hour urine sample for calcium would not be the most appropriate next step. Thyroid disorders are not directly linked to nephrolithiasis so a TSH level is not indicated. Repeat urine studies will not affect management. A CT scan in the emergency department was sufficient to rule out anatomic abnormality, so renal ultrasonography is not necessary. 49
