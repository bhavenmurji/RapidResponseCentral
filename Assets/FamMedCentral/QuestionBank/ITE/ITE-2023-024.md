# Question ITE-2023-024

A 64-year-old female presents to your office with a 1-week history of lesions on her legs (shown below). Her past medical history includes GERD, hypertension, and obesity. Her current medications include lisinopril (Zestril) and pantoprazole (Protonix). There is tenderness over the lesions but no itching or discharge. She feels well currently but recently completed a 3-day course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim) for treatment of a urinary tract infection. The lesions started to appear about 3–4 days after finishing her course of antibiotics. She is normotensive and afebrile. A physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Erythema nodosum

**B.** Necrobiosis lipoidica

**C.** Purpura fulminans

**D.** Pyoderma gangrenosum

**E.** Superficial thrombophlebitis

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Tender, symmetric erythematous nodules on the lower extremities are consistent with erythema nodosum (EN), the most common form of panniculitis. EN is a result of a hypersensitivity reaction to an antigen. The nodules are usually of acute onset, 1–6 cm in diameter, and occur symmetrically on the pretibial areas but can also appear on the thighs, ankles, and forearms. They generally resolve without ulceration or scarring within 1–6 weeks. While the etiology is usually unknown, they can be due to an infection (often streptococcal), systemic disease (such as Behçet syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, or medications (sulfonamides, penicillins, and oral contraceptives are most common). Depending on the clinical picture and presence of systemic disease, the workup can include biopsy and laboratory testing. 9  Necrobiosis lipoidica is strongly associated with diabetes mellitus, and occurs as reddish-brown plaques on the anterior legs. Purpura fulminans is associated with severe disseminated intravascular coagulation and is characterized by large ecchymoses that evolve into bullae, then black necrotic lesions. Patients are severely ill with associated hypotension. Pyoderma gangrenosum is exquisitely tender with pain out of proportion to appearance. It appears as a rapidly developing large ulceration arising from an initial pustule or papule. Superficial thrombophlebitis is characterized by tender isolated venous nodules that are rarely numerous and symmetric.
