# Question ITE-2024-196

## Question
A 45 -year-old male with a history of hypertension and poorly controlled anxiety and depression 
presents to your office to establish care. He requests refills of his current medications, which include 
the following:  
Alprazolam (Xanax), 0.5 mg nightly  
Buspirone, 10 mg 3 times daily  
Gabapentin (Neurontin), 600 mg 3 times daily  
Lorazepam (Ativan), 1 mg twice daily  
Losartan (Cozaar), 50 mg daily  
Sertraline (Zoloft), 200 mg daily  
You tell the patient that you will provide refills for buspirone, gabapentin, losartan, and sertraline 
without dosage adjustments; however, he will need to taper and ultimately discontinue the alprazolam 
and lorazepam. You both agree hospitalization is not necessary. After discussion, the patient agrees with your approach.  
 
In addition to cognitive behavioral thera py, which one of the following strategies would be most 
appropriate for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Discontinuing both benzodiazepines and initiating buprenorphine maintenance therapy
**B)** Discontinuing both benzodiazepines and initiating flumazenil maintenance therapy
**C)** Discontinuing lorazepam now and gradually decreasing alprazolam over 6 months
**D)** Tapering the alprazolam and lorazepam dosages simultaneously over 6 months
**E)** Switching both alprazolam and lorazepam to diazepam (Valium), and then decreasing the diazepam dosage over 6 months

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Benzodiazepine prescriptions and overdoses have increased over the last 15 years and long-term benzodiazepine use is rarely recommended. Current recommendations include the following: substitution of multiple benzodiazepines for a single longer -acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam, tapering of medication over weeks to months, and use of cognitive behavioral therapy. Buprenorphine is indicated for patients with opioid use disorder and can be helpful for patients who are taking both opioids and benzodiazepi nes. Flumazenil is an intravenous injection that is used for benzodiazepine overdoses and reversing benzodiazepine sedation. It is not used in maintenance therapy for benzodiazepine cessation.
