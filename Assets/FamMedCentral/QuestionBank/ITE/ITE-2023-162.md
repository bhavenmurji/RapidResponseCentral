# Question ITE-2023-162

Which one of the following topical corticosteroids should be AVOIDED for long-term use on the face?

## Options

**A.** Clobetasol 0.05% lotion (Clobex)

**B.** Desonide 0.05% ointment (Desowen)

**C.** Hydrocortisone 1% lotion

**D.** Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream

**E.** Triamcinolone 0.025% cream

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Topical corticosteroids are extremely common agents prescribed by family physicians and it is important to understand the safe and appropriate use of these agents. Many common dermatologic conditions are best treated with mid- or low-potency corticosteroids, but some conditions will only improve with high-potency agents. High-potency agents should typically be avoided on the face and eyelids, and on infants. These agents should be used as sparingly as possible when indicated and tapered off (SOR B). Of the agents listed, clobetasol 0.05% lotion is a very high-potency corticosteroid and should be avoided for long-term use on the face. Desonide 0.05% ointment, hydrocortisone 1% lotion, hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, and triamcinolone 0.025% cream are low-potency corticosteroids.
