# Question ITE-2023-198

A male with active tuberculosis in the United States refuses treatment. Which one of the following entities has the ultimate power to enforce isolation and treatment of this patient in order to protect public health and safety?

## Options

**A.** No entities

**B.** City government

**C.** County government

**D.** State government

**E.** Federal government

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

In the United States, the Supreme Court has held that states have plenary power (ability to enact and enforce public health laws), but are subject to constitutional constraints. This enforcement may be delegated to county or city governments, but starts at the state level. The federal government lacks police enforcement power.
