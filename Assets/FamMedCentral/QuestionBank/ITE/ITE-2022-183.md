# Question ITE-2022-183

normal, but he mentions that he has an overwhelming urge to keep checking and rechecking doors to make sure they are locked. He senses that something dangerous will happen if he does not do this. These thoughts and behaviors have become very distressing to him, and have started to interfere with his work and home life. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time?

## Options

**A.** Alprazolam (Xanax)

**B.** Risperidone (Risperdal)

**C.** Sertraline (Zoloft)

**D.** Referral for psychodynamic psychotherapy

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 3% of the population and is characterized by intrusive
thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Obsessions are often religious, sexual, or
violent in nature. They may include pathological doubting, preoccupation with contamination, concerns
with symmetry, and a sense that something unpleasant or dangerous will happen if a particular ritual is not
performed precisely. Typical compulsions include counting, checking, repeating, cleaning, and arranging
behaviors. For the diagnosis to be made, these symptoms must be severe enough to cause marked distress
or to impair functioning.
Most patients develop symptoms prior to age 35, and a large number of them keep these symptoms a
secret. There is often a delay of 5â€“10 years before the illness comes to medical attention. With optimum
treatment, 90% have moderate to marked improvement.
