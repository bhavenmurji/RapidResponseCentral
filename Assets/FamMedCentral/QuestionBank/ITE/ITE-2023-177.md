# Question ITE-2023-177

A 20-year-old college football player is struck by another athlete and is lying still in the supine position on the field. On examination on the field, the athlete reports bilateral numbness, tingling, and pain radiating to his fingertips but does not appear to be confused. He is alert and apprehensive of cervical range of motion but does not exhibit weakness of the upper extremities. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate management for this athlete? is unremarkable examination is normal may remain on the sideline but may not re-enter the same game transporting him to the emergency department (ED) via EMS if symptoms continue for more than 15 minutes EMS

## Options

**A.** Immediate examination for neurologic compromise and return to play if the examination

**B.** Return to play if symptoms resolve in less than 15 minutes and a repeat neurologic

**C.** Serial neurologic examinations; if there is no progression of neurologic symptoms, he

**D.** Immediate removal of his helmet and pads sequentially, log-rolling him, and

**E.** Keeping his helmet and pads intact, log-rolling him, and transporting him to the ED via

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

According to consensus recommendations, athletes with suspected neck injuries and red flags such as bilateral symptoms of pain, numbness, tingling, and apprehension of cervical range of motion should be assumed to have a cervical spine injury and should be log-rolled without removal of helmet and pads, and transported via EMS to the emergency department (SOR C). Due to red flags concerning neck injury in this athlete, it is not safe for him to return to the field and he should be emergently transported for further assessment and diagnostic imaging. This athlete reported bilateral symptoms, and 15 minutes of resolution is not considered acceptable for release and return to play. In the case of a cervical spine injury with associated altered mental status and/or airway compromise, the helmet and pads may be removed but only simultaneously to avoid further cervical injury. Resolution of symptoms within 5 minutes, lack of bilaterality, and a normal neurologic examination may allow for return to play at the physicianâ€™s discretion.
