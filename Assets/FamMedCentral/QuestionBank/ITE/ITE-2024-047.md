# Question ITE-2024-047

## Question
A 70 -year-old male presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal 
pain that radiates to his back. The patient has a history of stroke, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. 
He has a 40 -pack-year smoking history. A physical examination reveals a pulsatile mass just above 
the umbilicus. CT of the abdomen confirms the diagnosis.  
 
Which one of the following is the greatest ris k factor for developing this condition?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Cigarette smoking
**B)** Hypertension
**C)** Male sex
**D)** Stroke
**E)** Type 2 diabetes

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that may have ruptured. Tobacco use (in the form of cigarette smoking) is the greatest risk factor for developing AAA. Current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend one -time abdominal screening ultrasonography for all men ages 65 â€“75 who have ever smoked. Additional risk factors include hypertension, male sex, stroke, a family history of AAA, obesity, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and age >65.
