# Question ITE-2023-099

You recently initiated treatment for hypertension in a 65-year-old male. One week later his creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 2.4 mg/dL (N 0.6â€“1.2). You consider renal artery stenosis as an etiology because you are treating his hypertension with which one of the following medications? 37 39 ---

## Options

**A.** Amlodipine (Norvasc)

**B.** Chlorthalidone

**C.** Lisinopril (Zestril)

**D.** Metoprolol

**E.** Spironolactone (Aldactone)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

A creatinine elevation can occur as a result of decreased glomerular pressure, which can follow the initiation of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, renal artery stenosis should be considered when this elevation is >50% of the initial creatinine value. Amlodipine, chlorthalidone, metoprolol, and spironolactone would not cause a significant rise in creatinine levels related to renal artery stenosis.
