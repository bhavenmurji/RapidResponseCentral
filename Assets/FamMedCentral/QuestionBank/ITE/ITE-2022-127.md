# Question ITE-2022-127

has not had any vaginal bleeding since her last period at age 51. An examination reveals thin, dry labia minora and sparse pubic hair. The vaginal mucosa is smooth and pale with a frothy yellow discharge. A point-of-care urinalysis shows moderate leukocytes and trace protein. Microscopy of vaginal secretions reveals motile flagellates. Which one of the following medications is most likely to resolve this patientâ€™s symptoms?

## Options

**A.** Estradiol vaginal cream, 2 g vaginally daily

**B.** Fluconazole (Diflucan), 150 mg as a single dose

**C.** Doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 7 days

**D.** Metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days

**E.** Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim), 800/160 mg twice daily for 7 days

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of vaginitis, which can be caused by vaginal infections,
atrophy, and irritation from pads, panty liners, soaps, and perfumes. Atrophic vaginitis due to lack of
estrogen is common in postmenopausal females. The condition responds to estrogen therapy, but infectious
causes must first be ruled out. The presence of motile flagellates confirms the diagnosis of Trichomonas
vaginitis, which would be treated with oral metronidazole, either as a one-time 2-g dose or 500 mg twice
daily for 7 days. Estradiol, fluconazole, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim are not used for
the treatment of Trichomonas .
