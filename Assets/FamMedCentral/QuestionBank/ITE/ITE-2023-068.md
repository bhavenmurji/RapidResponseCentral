# Question ITE-2023-068

A 70-year-old male presents for evaluation of an itchy rash (shown below) that started a few weeks ago in the interdigital areas of both feet. The rash has since extended to his dorsal feet and ankles. He has tried using a topical moisturizing lotion and hydrocortisone 1% cream without improvement. Based on the extent of skin involvement, you offer him an oral medication to treat the infection. He is concerned about the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and asks if he could use a different topical medication instead. Of the following options, which one is most likely to resolve his symptoms?

## Options

**A.** Clotrimazole/betamethasone dipropionate (Lotrisone) cream

**B.** Mupirocin cream

**C.** Nystatin cream

**D.** Nystatin ointment

**E.** Terbinafine cream

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Tinea infections, such as the tinea pedis seen in this patient, are caused by dermatophytes, which include the three genera Trichophyton , Microsporum , and Epidermophyton . The rash of tinea pedis is often limited to the webspace between the toes and/or the plantar aspect of the foot but infections may also involve the dorsum of the foot, even into the ankle region. This patient’s more proximal involvement displays the classic “ringworm” pattern with an active border that is red, raised, and scaly. Cases in which the diagnosis is in doubt may be confirmed by a potassium hydroxide skin scraping that demonstrates the presence of hyphae. Most cases of tinea pedis respond well to topical therapy. Systemic treatment may be indicated in cases with widespread skin involvement, immunocompromise, failed topical treatment, or the chronic moccasin pattern marked by plantar and lateral foot hyperkeratosis, erythema, and silvery-white scale. Of the available oral options, ketoconazole is the most hepatotoxic and therefore should be avoided for the treatment of any tinea infection; however, itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine are all suitable alternatives. In this case, the patient has reasonably requested a trial of topical treatment. Newer fungicidal agents, such as butenafine and terbinafine, work more effectively and require a shorter treatment course than older fungistatic alternatives such as clotrimazole. Combination products that include corticosteroids, such as clotrimazole/betamethasone, should be avoided because they can aggravate fungal infections. Mupirocin is an antibiotic used for limited skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes but does not play a role in treatment of tinea infections without bacterial superinfection. This patient has a classic appearance of a tinea infection without evidence of superimposed cellulitis or abscess; therefore, an antibacterial medication is not indicated. Nystatin is useful for treating cutaneous Candida infections, but is ineffective for dermatophyte infections.
