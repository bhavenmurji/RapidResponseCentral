# Question ITE-2022-162

widespread, slightly pink macules on his chest and back. A KOH preparation is shown below. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?

## Options

**A.** Topical nystatin cream

**B.** Topical selenium sulfide

**C.** Topical triamcinolone cream

**D.** Oral fluconazole (Diflucan)

**E.** Oral nystatin

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This image shows typical hyphae of pityriasis versicolor, a superficial infection caused by yeasts in the
genus Malassezia . Of the listed therapies, topical selenium sulfide would be the most appropriate first-line
treatment. Topical antifungals such as terbinafine and miconazole are other first-line options. Oral
fluconazole can be used, but oral therapy is usually reserved for when topical treatment is impractical or
unsuccessful. Topical nystatin cream and oral nystatin are ineffective, and topical corticosteroids such as
triamcinolone may temporarily suppress symptoms while exacerbating the infection.
