# Question ITE-2024-172

## Question
An 89 -year-old female with end -stage, widely metastatic lung cancer is receiving hospice care. Her 
symptoms, including pain, have been well controlled until recently. According to her caregiver, she is 
now experiencing excessive oropharyngeal secretions.  
 
Which one of the following medications would most effectively control t his patient’s secretions?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Chlorpheniramine/hydrocodone suspension
**B)** Glycopyrrolate
**C)** Haloperidol
**D)** Hydroxyzine
**E)** Morphine

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Symptom management at the end of life aims to provide comfort and dignity for patients and their families. One of the common symptoms at the end of life is excessive oropharyngeal secretions. This can cause increased noisy breathing in the last hours to days of life, often referred to as a death rattle. Terminal secretions do not result in airway obstruction or respiratory distress for the patient but can be distressing to family members who are concerned that the patient is “drowning” in secretions. Family members often request that suctioning be performed; however, this does not reduce the rattling noise and can cause further distress to the patient. Anticholinergic medications can be used to reduce the volume of secretions and noisy breathing, but there is little high -quality evidence to support this practice. Glycopyrrolate, hyoscyamine, and transdermal scopolamine may also be used. Neither chlorpheniramine/hydrocodone nor hydroxyzine has a role in typical end -of-life care. Haloperidol is effective for the treatment of delirium. Opioids such as morphine are used to treat dyspnea (SOR B) but have no effect on secretions.
