# Question ITE-2023-141

A 55-year-old male with oxygen-dependent COPD plans to visit family 2000 miles away. For the last year, his COPD has been well controlled on medications and oxygen at 2 L/min. He wants to travel by commercial airline. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate advice for this patient regarding air travel?

## Options

**A.** Choosing another mode of transit

**B.** Flying first class only

**C.** Continuing his oxygen flow rate at 2 L/min during the flight

**D.** Lowering his oxygen flow rate to 1 L/min during the flight

**E.** Doubling his oxygen flow rate to 4 L/min during the flight

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Commercial airline carriers typically permit Federal Aviation Administrationâ€“approved portable oxygen compressors. Patients whose usual oxygen requirements are <4 L/min are advised to double the flow rate during the flight. Conditions such as bullous lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe COPD may require the Hypoxia Altitude Simulation Test to determine in-flight oxygen requirements prior to air travel. It would not be appropriate to recommend this patient choose another mode of transit, fly first class only, continue his current oxygen flow rate, or lower his oxygen flow rate.
