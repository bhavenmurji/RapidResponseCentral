# Question ITE-2024-116

## Question
A 58 -year-old female presents with concerns about hair loss. She has noticed increased hair shedding 
over the last few years and has recently noticed hair thinning. On examination she has thinning at the 
center frontal hairline. You diagnose female pattern hair loss. She is interested in a topical or 
systemic treatment.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial pharmacologic treatment for this 
patientâ€™s hair loss?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Topical estradiol
**B)** Topical minoxidil (Rogaine)
**C)** Transdermal testosterone (AndroGel)
**D)** Oral medroxyprogesterone (Provera)
**E)** Oral spironolactone (Aldactone)

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
The initial pharmacologic management for female pattern hair loss is topical minoxidil. Topical finasteride in combination with topical minoxidil has also been shown to be efficacious. Similarly, oral spironolactone may be efficacious when used in combinat ion with topical minoxidil, but there is no evidence for spironolactone as monotherapy. While low estrogen levels likely play a role in female pattern hair loss, there is no current evidence that using estrogen, progestin, or testosterone is helpful and th ese are not recommended.
