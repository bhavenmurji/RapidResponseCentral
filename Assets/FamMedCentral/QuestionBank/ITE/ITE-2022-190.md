# Question ITE-2022-190

antivirals?

## Options

**A.** Behçet’s syndrome

**B.** Hand-foot-and-mouth disease

**C.** Herpangina

**D.** Herpes gingivostomatitis

**E.** Vincent’s angina

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Herpes gingivostomatitis is the enanthem associated with a primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) herpes simplex virus 1 infection, and
it is the only condition listed here that is treated with antivirals such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. Behçet’s
syndrome is an inflammatory condition presenting with oral and genital aphthous ulcerations. The cause
is unknown and it is frequently managed with topical or systemic corticosteroids or colchicine.
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease and herpangina are caused by coxsackie or enterovirus and supportive care
is most appropriate for both of these. Vincent’s angina (also known as trench mouth or necrotizing
ulcerative gingivitis) is a bacterial infection of the gingiva associated with poor hygiene. It is treated with
systemic antibiotics such as metronidazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate.
