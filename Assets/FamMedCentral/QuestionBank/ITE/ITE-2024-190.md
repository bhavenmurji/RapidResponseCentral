# Question ITE-2024-190

## Question
A 6-year-old male is brought to your office by his parents for follow -up after being seen in the 
emergency department (ED) for an unprovoked, nonfebrile seizure. He does not have any prior 
seizure history and his past medical history is unremarkable. An EE G in the ED was normal. The 
parents are concerned about his risk for recurrent seizure and ask about treatment with anti -epileptic 
drug (AED) therapy.  
 
Which one of the following should you recommend?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Starting AED monotherapy only if he has a second seizure
**B)** Starting AED monotherapy now
**C)** Starting combination AED therapy only if he has a second seizure
**D)** for an unprovoked, nonfebrile seizure. He does not have any prior seizure history and his past medical history is unremarkable. An EE G in the ED was normal. The parents are concerned about his risk f

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
In the absence of risk factors such as abnormal EEG results, the presence of a predisposition to seizures, or an etiology such as severe head trauma or cerebral palsy, anti-epileptic drug (AED) therapy is not indicated after a first unprovoked childhood seizure. There is no significant difference in 1 - to 2-year seizure remission rates between starting AED therapy after the first or second seizure, and there are significant risks associated with AED treatment. AED monotherapy should be attempted before starting AED combination therapy.
