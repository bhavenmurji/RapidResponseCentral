# Question ITE-2024-063

## Question
A 35 -year-old male with a medical history of hypertension and a family history of 
hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease sees you for routine follow -up of hypertension. His 
blood pressure is controlled on hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily, and losartan (Cozaar), 50 mg daily. 
He has a BMI of 30 kg/m2 and quit smoking tobacco 2 years ago.  
 
According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which one of the following is recommended 
for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Aspirin, 81 mg daily
**B)** Low- to moderate -intensity statin therapy
**C)** Moderate -intensity exercise for 120 minutes per week
**D)** Referral to behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to his hypertension, family history, elevated BMI, and smoking history. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for the primary prevention of CVD, adults with CVD risk factors should be referred to behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity. The USPSTF recommends shared decision -making for low -dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in patients 40 –59 ye ars of age who have a 10% or greater 10 -year risk of CVD. The USPSTF recommends statin therapy for the primary prevention of CVD in patients 40 – 75 years of age who do not have a history of CVD but do have ≥1 CVD risk factors plus a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% –10%. The USPSTF does not make a recommendation for a specific exercise program.
