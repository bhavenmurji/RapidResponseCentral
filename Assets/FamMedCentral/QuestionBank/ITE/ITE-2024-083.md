# Question ITE-2024-083

## Question
A 70 -year-old male with well -controlled hypertension reports that he slipped and fell in his bedroom 
2 weeks ago. The fall did not result in any injuries. He has heard that tai chi is effective at reducing fall risk in older adults, but no classes are offered locally. He asks about other options to prevent 
future falls.  
 
You should tell this patient that in older adults, evidence shows that any type of exercise

## Answer Choices
**A)** decreases fall risk for women but not men
**B)** decreases health -related quality of life
**C)** reduces the rate of falls
**D)** reduces the rate of falls requiring hospital admission

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Evidence shows that in older, community -dwelling adults, all types of exercise reduce the rate of falls by 23% (rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71 to 0.83) and the number of persons experiencing â‰¥1 falls in 1 year by 15% (risk ratio 0.85, 9 5% CI 0.81 to 0.89). More women than men have been studied in exercise research, but exercise appears to show similar reductions in falls for men. Exercise has not been found to make a significant difference in quality of life in older adults. The evidence is insufficient to determine if exercise programs decrease fall -related hospital admissions.
