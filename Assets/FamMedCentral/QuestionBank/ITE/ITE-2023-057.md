# Question ITE-2023-057

A 28-year-old female comes to your office for follow-up after learning during an emergency department visit that she is pregnant. Ultrasonography reveals an estimated gestational age of 14 weeks and 4 days. She has been using increasing dosages of oxycodone (OxyContin) daily for the past 7 months and gets sick whenever she tries to stop. She reports using 90 mg daily without a prescription, and stealing when necessary to obtain the drug. She wishes to continue her pregnancy and is worried about the safety of her developing fetus. Which one of the following is most appropriate for this patient?

## Options

**A.** A prescription for oxycodone, 90 mg daily

**B.** Buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) therapy

**C.** Outpatient detoxification with a clonidine-based protocol

**D.** Inpatient detoxification with a clonidine-based protocol

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, along with counseling, is considered optimal care for all pregnant women with active opioid addiction. Benefits include the avoidance of cycles of withdrawal and intoxication and a decrease in high-risk behaviors associated with opioid dependence and associated medical complications. A prescription for oxycodone would not be appropriate for this patient. Medically supervised withdrawal is associated with dramatically higher rates of relapse, and should only be offered to women who refuse maintenance therapy or are unable to access such therapy.
