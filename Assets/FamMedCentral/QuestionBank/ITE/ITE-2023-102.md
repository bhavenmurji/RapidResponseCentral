# Question ITE-2023-102

A 63-year-old female presents with pain in her right hand. She states that for 3 months she has experienced a catching sensation and her ring finger occasionally locks into a claw-like form. On examination a nodule is palpated and her pain is localized to the volar surface of the metacarpophalangeal joint on her ring finger. When instructed to clench her fist and subsequently release, her ring finger remains in a flexed position. Which one of the following is considered first-line treatment for this condition? 38 40 --- 39 41 ---

## Options

**A.** Buddy taping

**B.** Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit therapy

**C.** Corticosteroid injection

**D.** Physical therapy

**E.** Surgical release

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

First-line therapy for stenosing flexor tenosynovitis, or trigger finger, is a corticosteroid injection into the affected flexor tendon sheath (SOR A). It may take 1–4 weeks for the patient to experience relief. Splinting may be considered if the patient is not a candidate for corticosteroid injections. Buddy taping, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit therapy, and physical therapy are not effective treatments for trigger finger. Surgical correction may be considered after 2–3 corticosteroid injections are attempted without improvement of symptoms.
