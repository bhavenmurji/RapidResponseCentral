# Question ITE-2023-100

Your office staff proposes a practice improvement project to create a transgender-friendly clinical environment. Which one of the following interventions would help promote this goal?

## Options

**A.** Ensuring that intake forms and records use gender-neutral or inclusive language

**B.** Offering preventive services based on expressed gender only

**C.** Offering referral to a transgender clinic to all patients

**D.** Polling the staff to see if any of them are transgender

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Many transgender patients report negative experiences with health care providers, which can lead to avoidance of health care interactions. It is important to create a safe and welcoming environment to establish and maintain rapport. Ensuring that intake forms and records use gender-neutral or inclusive language is one way to signal this. Preventive services should be offered based on the patientâ€™s current anatomy, not on expressed gender. Offering a referral to a transgender clinic to all patients is not necessary. Asking staff if they are transgender is invasive and unnecessary, and they may not be willing to disclose this information.
