# Question ITE-2022-160

low-grade fever that started the night before. His mother awoke early in the morning when she heard his barking cough. He recently started attending preschool and the mother does not know of any sick contacts. On initial examination the patient is in mild respiratory distress and appears nontoxic. He does not have any rhinorrhea or congestion. He has a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), a respiratory rate of 40/min, a heart rate of 145 beats/min, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. No rashes or petechiae are present. The most appropriate next step in management would be

## Options

**A.** humidified air

**B.** albuterol via nebulizer

**C.** oral dexamethasone

**D.** a viral culture

**E.** a chest radiograph

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patient has a classic presentation of croup, which peaks in the fall and winter months. There may not
be any particular history of sick contacts and it does not present with a prodrome, in contrast to respiratory
syncytial virus. The diagnosis of croup is purely clinical and does not require laboratory studies, viral
cultures, or imaging (SOR C). The treatment of croup includes corticosteroids such as dexamethasone in
mild cases (SOR A) and the addition of epinephrine in moderate to severe cases (SOR A). The inhalation
of humidified air does not improve outcomes (SOR B) nor does nebulized albuterol.
