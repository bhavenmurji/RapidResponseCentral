# Question ITE-2023-029

A 71-year-old male who resides at sea level travels to Colorado for a vacation. He spends the first night in a resort at 2700 m (8858 ft) above sea level. He notes a headache and sleeps poorly. The next morning he is somewhat nauseated and lightheaded, but feels well enough to proceed with his plans and ascends to his campsite at 4000 m (13,123 ft). During the first evening at the campsite, friends note that he is confused and having difficulty with his balance. Which one of the following diagnoses best explains his symptoms at the campsite?

## Options

**A.** Acute mountain sickness

**B.** High-altitude cerebral edema

**C.** High-altitude headache

**D.** High altitudeâ€“induced central sleep apnea

**E.** High-altitude pulmonary edema

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient likely had a high-altitude headache on arrival, central sleep apnea during his first night in the hotel, and acute mountain sickness by the next morning. None of these conditions are life-threatening, and proper acclimatization would have been helpful. The addition of ataxia and confusion to his symptom list points to high-altitude cerebral edema, which can progress to coma and death. Immediate descent is indicated. Symptoms of high-altitude pulmonary edema include cough with pinkish sputum, respiratory distress, and cyanosis.
