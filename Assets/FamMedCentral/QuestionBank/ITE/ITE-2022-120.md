# Question ITE-2022-120

seen by a physician since 2 weeks of age due to parental concerns about seeking care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her growth and development appear to be normal. Which one of the following vaccines is CONTRAINDICATED today?

## Options

**A.** Haemophilus influenzae  type b

**B.** Hepatitis B

**C.** Inactivated poliovirus

**D.** 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13, Prevnar 13)

**E.** Rotavirus

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Vaccine delay and vaccine hesitancy are on the rise in the United States, so family physicians should be
familiar with the nuances of vaccine catch-up schedules as well as contraindications. Rotavirus vaccine has
age restrictions and should not be initiated after 14 weeks and 6 days of age. In addition, the rotavirus
series must be complete by 8 months of age. These age restrictions are intended to ensure the vaccine is
administered when it will be of maximal benefit to children given the slightly increased risk of
intussusception after vaccine administration. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at routine
intervals. Haemophilus influenzae  type b, inactivated poliovirus, and pneumococcal conjugate can all be
administered to this patient today. However, these vaccines have complex follow-up intervals based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) on the
age at prior doses and age at catch-up. Therefore, the clinician should consult the CDC catch-up vaccine
schedule to verify dosing intervals.
