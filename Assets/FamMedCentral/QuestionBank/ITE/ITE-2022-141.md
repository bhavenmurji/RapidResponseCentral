# Question ITE-2022-141

of 90/52 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. An examination reveals a child who is occasionally coughing but is in no acute distress. The mucous membranes are moist and capillary refill time is 2 seconds. There are no retractions, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles of respiration, or any other signs of respiratory distress. The heart is mildly tachycardic without murmur and the lungs have rhonchi in the left lung base. Rapid tests for influenza and COVID-19 are negative. You suspect typical community-acquired pneumonia. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patientâ€™s condition?

## Options

**A.** Oral amoxicillin

**B.** Oral doxycycline

**C.** Intramuscular ceftriaxone

**D.** Withholding antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed with radiography

**E.** Hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This child presents with symptoms and signs consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. Since the
child is well hydrated and in no distress, outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics is most appropriate. The
preferred first-line antibiotic is amoxicillin. In patients older than 7 years of age, doxycycline is an
alternative option when an atypical bacterial cause is presumed likely. Intramuscular ceftriaxone,
withholding antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed with radiography, and hospitalization for
intravenous antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case.
