# Question ITE-2024-040

## Question
A 55 -year-old female presents with numbness and tingling in the ring and little fingers of her right 
hand. She also reports weakness when gripping objects and difficulty spreading her fingers apart. A 
physical examination reveals weakness of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and cla wing of the ring 
and little fingers. A Tinel sign is positive over the medial epicondyle of the right elbow.  
 
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Axillary nerve compression
**B)** Carpal tunnel syndrome
**C)** Cubital tunnel syndrome
**D)** Median nerve neuropathy
**E)** Radial tunnel syndrome

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient's symptoms and the physical examination findings are classic for ulnar nerve compression at the elbow, also known as cubital tunnel syndrome. Numbness and tingling in the ring and little fingers, weakness in grip, and clawing of the fingers are all indicative of ulnar nerve dysfunction. A positive Tinel sign over the medial epicondyle further strengthens the diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent permanent nerve damage. Axillary nerve compression would produce paresthesias or pain of the lateral shoulder and weakness in external shoulder rotation, extension, abduction, and forward flexion. Carpal tunnel syndrome affects the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve, and causes numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger. Median nerve neuropathy would cause symptoms similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, but not weakness of the first dorsal interosseous muscle or clawing of the fingers. Radial tunnel syndrome affects the radial nerve and causes weakness and sensory loss in the back of the hand and thumb.
