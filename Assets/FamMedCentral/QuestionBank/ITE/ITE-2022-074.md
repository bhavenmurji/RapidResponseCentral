# Question ITE-2022-074

workouts. There was no obvious contact or injury. Upon assessment, he is awake but somnolent and diaphoretic. He reports a headache and is unable to identify where he is or the day of the week. His core temperature is 40.2°C (104.4°F). Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Exercise-associated collapse

**B.** Heat edema

**C.** Heat exhaustion

**D.** Heat injury

**E.** Heatstroke

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The prompt recognition of heatstroke is critical to effective treatment. Heatstroke is characterized by a core
temperature >40°C (104°F) in association with neurologic abnormalities such as headache, confusion,
altered mental status, irritability, and seizure. Exercise-associated collapse, previously called heat syncope,
generally occurs immediately after strenuous exercise and is more associated with hydration status. Heat
edema is a benign condition manifested by mild swelling in the extremities and facial flushing in a patient
with a normal temperature. Heat exhaustion may involve neurologic symptoms but is associated with a
lower temperature (38.3°C–40.0°C [101°F–104°F]) and thus a better outcome. Like heatstroke, heat
injury can be associated with a temperature >40°C, but does not involve neurologic symptoms. Instead,
kidney, muscle, or liver injury may be present.
