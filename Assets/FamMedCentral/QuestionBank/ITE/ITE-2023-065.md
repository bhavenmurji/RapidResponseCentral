# Question ITE-2023-065

A 45-year-old male sees you to review the results of a male hormone imbalance test that he took online. On the list of symptoms, he marked decreased sex drive and excessive sweating as severe; fatigue, mood changes, sleep problems, and muscle strength as moderate; and hair loss, decreased mental ability, weight gain, and muscle and joint pain as mild. The patient has no known chronic diseases and takes a daily multivitamin. His medical history and a physical examination are unremarkable. He would like to start testosterone therapy as soon as possible. After discussing the limited indications for testosterone replacement, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step to address this patientâ€™s concerns?

## Options

**A.** Reassurance only

**B.** FSH and LH levels

**C.** A total testosterone level at the end of this visit

**D.** Two separate fasting morning total testosterone levels

**E.** A clinical trial of testosterone replacement

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A diagnosis of hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency should be confirmed by unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations. Significant diurnal and day-to-day variations affect testosterone concentration measurements. Testosterone levels are also affected by food intake and blood glucose levels. The 2018 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend that measurements of total testosterone concentrations should be obtained on two separate fasting morning specimens, using an accurate, reliable, and certified laboratory assay method. Because acute illness can also affect testosterone levels, testing should be postponed until after full recovery. Testing for testosterone deficiency in men on short-term treatment with medications such as opioids or cimetidine, which can suppress testosterone concentrations, should also be delayed until after the treatment ends. LH and FSH levels should be obtained once low testosterone has been confirmed, in order to help differentiate between primary or secondary hypogonadism. According to the 2020 evidence-based guidelines from the American College of Physicians, testosterone replacement is recommended for men with age-related testosterone deficiency and sexual dysfunction, and is not recommended to help with physical function, cognition, or energy.
