# Question ITE-2022-104

Which one of the following is true regarding acute gastroenteritis in children?

## Options

**A.** Handwashing and general hygiene alone can prevent rotavirus infection

**B.** Daily probiotics are recommended

**C.** The majority of cases are caused by bacteria

**D.** Oral rehydration is as effective as intravenous rehydration in mild to moderate dehydration

**E.** Promethazine is the antiemetic of choice in patients with moderate dehydration and nausea

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous rehydration in preventing hospitalizations and return emergency department visits in children with mild to moderate dehydration from acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus infection cannot be prevented by handwashing and hygiene alone, and infants should receive the rotavirus vaccine to reduce the risk of rotavirus infection and associated complications. The benefit of probiotics for treatment of acute gastroenteritis is not yet clear. The majority of acute gastroenteritis infections in children are caused by viruses, not bacteria. Ondansetron is the antiemetic of choice for children, as older antiemetics, including promethazine and metoclopramide, have higher rates of adverse reactions.
