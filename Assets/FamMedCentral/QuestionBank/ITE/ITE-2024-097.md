# Question ITE-2024-097

## Question
A 72 -year-old female presents with suspected tinnitus. She describes a long -standing, low -grade 
ringing in both ears that seems to be worsening over time. She started using hearing aids last month 
for a recent diagnosis of presbycusis, but the tinnitus has  not improved. It is nonpulsatile and not 
associated with any other symptoms including headache, numbness, tingling, or weakness. 
Examination findings, including a neurologic examination and an ear examination, are normal except 
for her known hearing loss.  
 
Which one of the following has the best evidence of improving quality of life in patients such as this?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
**B)** Acupuncture
**C)** Cognitive behavioral therapy
**D)** Transcranial magnetic stimulation
**E)** Surgical microvascular decompression

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Tinnitus is a common problem with unknown etiology that can significantly impact quality of life. It can signify a more concerning underlying neurologic condition such as vestibular schwannoma, and it is also associated with the use of medications that cau se ototoxicity and with sensorineural hearing loss. Acute tinnitus can occur with otitis media, middle ear effusion, and cerumen impaction. Patients with tinnitus that is severe enough to cause distress should have an audiologic evaluation. Head imaging is only required in the setting of asymmetric or pulsatile tinnitus, asymmetric hearing loss, or abnormal neurologic findings. The treatment with the best evidence of improved quality of life related to tinnitus is cognitive behavioral therapy. Hearing aids may alleviate tinnitus in hearing -impaired patients. Individuals with depression or anxiety related to their tinnitus should receive treatment for those conditions. Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine do not have evidence of benefit and are not recommended. Other therapies with insufficient evidence of benefit include acupuncture, transcranial magnetic stimulation, surgical decompression of cranial nerve VIII, and hyperbaric oxygen.
