# Question ITE-2022-088

months. She reports irregular menses for the past 2 years. Her medical history is significant for Hashimoto thyroiditis that is currently controlled. A urine pregnancy test is negative. On examination you note vaginal dryness and labial atrophy. You suspect primary ovarian insufficiency. Which one of the following combinations of FSH and LH levels is consistent with this diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Normal FSH and normal LH

**B.** Low FSH and low LH

**C.** Low FSH and elevated LH

**D.** Elevated FSH and elevated LH

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

In a female younger than 40 years of age, elevated FSH and LH levels indicate primary ovarian
insufficiency. Ovarian insufficiency leads to low estrogen levels, which stimulate increased production of
FSH in the pituitary in a feedback loop. In this scenario, LH levels are high but do not rise as much as
FSH levels.

Normal FSH and LH levels may indicate an outflow tract obstruction. Low FSH and LH levels indicate
that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is suppressed, as in the female athlete triad when there is an excess of
energy expenditure compared to intake. Low FSH and elevated LH levels may be detected immediately
prior to ovulation as part of a normal cyclical pattern.
