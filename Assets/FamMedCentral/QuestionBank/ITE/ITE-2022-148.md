# Question ITE-2022-148

was born at 28 weeks gestation and had a month-long NICU stay but has remained healthy and out of the hospital since that time. He is up to date on vaccines and his growth and development are appropriate. He was on omeprazole (Prilosec) for GERD but the parents have recently stopped the medication and he is doing well. He received palivizumab (Synagis) monthly last year during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season and never developed a respiratory infection. His parents are hoping that he can receive palivizumab again this year to prevent complications if he develops RSV. He recently started attending day care and they are worried about his exposure risk. Which one of the following would you recommend this year for chemoprophylaxis against RSV in this patient?

## Options

**A.** No chemoprophylaxis

**B.** A single dose of palivizumab only if RSV exposure is confirmed

**C.** A single dose of palivizumab prior to RSV season

**D.** Monthly administration of palivizumab during RSV season

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

With the increasing shortage of pediatric providers, especially in rural areas, family physicians need to be
comfortable managing the care (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of premature infants. Palivizumab is recommended for all infants born
before 29 weeks gestational age who are less than 1 year of age at the beginning of respiratory syncytial
virus season, or for those born at less than 32 weeks gestational age who develop chronic lung disease of
prematurity. After 1 year of age, palivizumab is only recommended for infants with chronic lung disease
of prematurity who continue to require medical intervention for their lung disease. Therefore, this child
should not receive palivizumab.
