# Question ITE-2022-034

York to Florida to live with her daughter, after her partner died 2 years ago. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, and cachexia. Her current medications, which were prescribed by her previous primary care physician, include the following: Acetaminophen Hydrochlorothiazide Levothyroxine (Synthroid) Losartan (Cozaar) Megestrol (Megace) A multivitamin Her vital signs are unremarkable except for a 7% weight loss in the past year. A recent TSH level was within the normal range. Which one of the following medications should be discontinued?

## Options

**A.** Acetaminophen

**B.** Hydrochlorothiazide

**C.** Levothyroxine

**D.** Losartan

**E.** Megestrol

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Although it is considered an appetite stimulant, megestrol is not recommended in older adults due to
potential harmful side effects and a lack of evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) supporting improved outcomes for the treatment of
cachexia in the geriatric population, according to the American Geriatrics Society’s Choosing Wisely
recommendation. Acetaminophen is not considered a contributor to weight loss. Though loop diuretics,
spironolactone, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and propranolol may contribute to weight loss
due to their adverse effects, hydrochlorothiazide and angiotensin receptor blockers such as losartan are less
likely to contribute to weight loss and the patient’s hypertension is currently controlled on this regimen.
The patient’s hypothyroidism is currently stable, so changes to the levothyroxine dosage are unnecessary.

anorexia or cachexia in older adults; inst...
