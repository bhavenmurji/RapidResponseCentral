# Question ITE-2024-132

## Question
A 5-month -old infant is brought to the urgent care clinic by her parent for evaluation of cough and 
fever. The parent reports that their 2 school -aged children came home with colds 5 days ago. Home 
tests were negative for COVID -19. Last night the 5 -month -old infant developed a runny nose, 
sneezing, cough, and fever. The infant has also been sle eping more and nursing less.  
 
The infant’s vital signs are notable for a temperature of 38.8 °C (101.8 °F), a pulse rate of 140 
beats/min, a respiratory rate of 26/min, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. On 
examination you note mild grunting but no nasal flaring or supraclavicular retractions. Auscultation of the lungs reveals a prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse wheezing and coarse breath sounds.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate intervention at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Adequate hydration and nutrition
**B)** Azithromycin (Zithromax)
**C)** Dexamethasone
**D)** Viral testing
**E)** A chest x -ray

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient presents with symptoms and findings consistent with uncomplicated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Symptoms may include fever, lethargy, rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, cough, tachypnea, retractions, and difficulty feeding. Since this patient does not have any airway complications, concurrent bacterial infection, or need for hospitalization to manage oxygen therapy, treatment is primarily supportive. Ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition, with intravenous or nasogastric tube intervention if needed, is the most appropriate intervention at this time. Antibiotics such as azithromycin should not be used for the treatment of RSV bronchiolitis unless there is concern for a coexisting bacterial infection. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone should not be used for the treatment of RSV bronchiolitis since they do not decrease the risk for hospital admission or duration of stay. The diagnosis of RSV bronchiolitis is clinical and does not require viral testing for confirmation. Because chest x -rays do not improve outcomes or reduce antibiotic use, they should only be obtained if there is concern for airway complications.
