# Question ITE-2022-004

worsening agitation in the evenings. She is accompanied by her daughter who has power of attorney. The patient is dependent on her daughter for all instrumental activities of daily living and requires assistance with certain core activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing. She has no other chronic medical problems. Her daughter states that starting around 4:00 p.m., the patient becomes increasingly disoriented and agitated. There has been no physical aggression, but the daughter asks for medical intervention to “help calm her down.” Which one of the following should you recommend initiating first for the management of this patient’s symptoms?

## Options

**A.** Sensory stimulation including touch and music

**B.** Cognitive training

**C.** Haloperidol

**D.** Quetiapine (Seroquel)

**E.** Valproic acid

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient is experiencing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) as her cognitive
and functional status decline. Evening agitation is a common form of BPSD, often referred to as
sundowning . As with most BPSD, a nonpharmacologic approach to improve agitation has much stronger
evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) for efficacy compared to a pharmacologic approach. A recent network meta-analysis showed that
sensory stimulation, including massage, touch, and music therapy, significantly outperforms pharmacologic
intervention (level of evidence 1a). Cognitive training, especially for BPSD in the context of advanced
dementia, does not have strong evidence to support its use. Pharmacologic intervention should be initiated
with caution given the potential for side effects, and should be a last resort in situations where there is a
risk of self-harm or harm to others.
