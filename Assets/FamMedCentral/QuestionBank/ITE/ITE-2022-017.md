# Question ITE-2022-017

last month. She has noticed a gradual onset of fatigue, constipation, and cold intolerance over that time. A few weeks ago the patient took a selfie and was surprised by how puffy her face appeared in the photo. On examination her thyroid is diffusely enlarged and nontender and feels pebbly on palpation. An HEENT examination, including an eye examination, is otherwise normal. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis

**B.** Graves disease

**C.** Lymphadenitis

**D.** Lymphoma

**E.** Thyroid cancer

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patientâ€™s clinical picture is most consistent with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, traditionally known
as Hashimoto thyroiditis. This diagnosis is suggested by her neck fullness and symptoms of
hypothyroidism. Additionally, a nontender goiter that feels like pebbles on examination is classically
reported with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.
Graves disease typically presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism and, in many patients, orbitopathy
(eye bulging). A patient with lymphadenitis typically shows symptoms of a causative infection.
Lymphadenitis tends to rapidly enlarge the lymph nodes, which are also typically painful and tender.
Lymphoma more commonly presents with fevers, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, itchy skin, and
dyspnea.
This patient lacks a discrete thyroid nodule, which makes thyroid cancer less likely. Thyroid nodules are
more frequently painful, while the neck fullness in chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is usually painless and
nontender.
