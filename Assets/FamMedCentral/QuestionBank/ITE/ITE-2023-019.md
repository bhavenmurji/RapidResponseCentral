# Question ITE-2023-019

According to the American Diabetes Association, which one of the following hemoglobin A1c measurements fits the criteria for prediabetes? 7 9 ---

## Options

**A.** 5%

**B.** 5.5%

**C.** 6%

**D.** 6.5%

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Classifying prediabetes is important because it identifies a population at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future and provides an opportunity for prevention. According to the American Diabetes Association, a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7%–6.4% fits the criteria for prediabetes. Patients whose hemoglobin A1c falls into this range should attempt diabetes prevention including lifestyle changes, medication, cardiovascular risk prevention, and monitoring.
