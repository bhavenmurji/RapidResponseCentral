# Question ITE-2022-091

screening ultrasonography. Which one of the following is most important when determining the risk of his AAA rupturing?

## Options

**A.** His age

**B.** His sex

**C.** His history of hypertension

**D.** His history of smoking

**E.** The diameter of his aneurysm

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The single most important determinant of the risk that an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will rupture
is the diameter of the aneurysm. In men, aneurysm repair is recommended when the aneurysm reaches 5.5
cm in diameter. In women, whose aortas tend to be smaller, the recommended maximum diameter is 5.0
cm. Age, sex, a history of hypertension, and a history of smoking all increase the risk of developing an
AAA, but do not increase the risk of rupture.
