## Question
A 65 -year-old male presents to your office for a Welcome to Medicare visit. The whisper test is 
abnormal with both ears.  
 
In addition to difficulty hearing and participating in day -to-day conversation, the patient is at 
increased risk for which one of the following health problems due to his hearing loss ?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
**B)** Dementia
**C)** Ear infection
**D)** Heart failure
**E)** Temporomandibular joint dysfunction

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Hearing loss is associated with dementia , decreased quality of life, depression, debility, delirium, falls, and mortality. It does not increase the risk for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, ear infection, heart failure, or temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
