# Question ITE-2024-113

## Question
A healthy 16 -year-old male presents to your office for a sports preparticipation evaluation. The 
patientâ€™s parent has a close family friend with diabetes mellitus and asks you about screening the 
adolescent for the condition. He has no signs or symptoms of diabetes.  
 
Which one of the following is the current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recomme ndation 
regarding screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents?

## Answer Choices
**A)** They should not be screened
**B)** They should be screened only if they have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes
**C)** They should be screened only if they have morbid obesity
**D)** They should routinely be screened
**E)** There is not enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against screening

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
The most recent recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force regarding screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents states that there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against screening. Clinicians shoul d use their judgment when recommending screening for particular patients and keep in mind that there may be harm caused by screening. Some adolescents may have a transient physiologic period of insulin resistance during puberty, which can spontaneously rev ert to a normal state. Screening these patients may lead to overdiagnosis, labeling, and overtreatment.
