# Question ITE-2023-050

A 40-year-old male presents because he is losing large clumps of hair when he brushes or washes it. He feels well otherwise and does not take any medications. His past medical history is unremarkable except for a cholecystectomy 4 months ago for acute cholecystitis. A physical examination is normal except for uniform, diffuse thinning of the hair on his scalp. You do not observe any patches of hair loss, redness, inflammation, scaling, or scarring of his scalp. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient’s hair loss? 18 20 --- 19 21 ---

## Options

**A.** Reassurance only

**B.** Cognitive behavioral therapy

**C.** Terbinafine

**D.** Intracutaneous scalp corticosteroid injections

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

There are three phases of hair growth: the anagen, or growth phase; the catagen, or degeneration phase; and the telogen, or resting phase. It is during the telogen phase that hair sheds. This patient has telogen effluvium in which diffuse, not patchy, hair loss is caused by large numbers of hairs entering the telogen phase and falling out 3–5 months after a stressor. The stress may be emotional or physiologic, such as this patient’s acute cholecystitis with cholecystectomy. A history of hair coming out in clumps is suggestive of this diagnosis. The incidence is similar among age groups and sexes. Telogen effluvium is usually self-limited and resolves within 2–6 months. The treatment is reassurance. Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat trichotillomania, an impulse-control disorder in which patients pull, twist, or twirl hair, typically in the frontoparietal area. It can include the eyelashes and eyebrows. Terbinafine is an antifungal that can be used to treat tinea capitis, a patchy dermatophyte infection of the hair shaft and follicles that is associated with itching, scaling, and pustules. Intralesional corticosteroids can be used for alopecia areata where the hair loss pattern is patchy or involves the entire scalp. It can also involve the entire body. The hair loss is more gradual in this condition.
