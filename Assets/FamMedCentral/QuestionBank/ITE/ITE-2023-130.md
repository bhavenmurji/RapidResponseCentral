# Question ITE-2023-130

A 63-year-old retired banker presents for follow-up of diabetes mellitus. He has an 8-year history of diabetes and started metformin 7 years ago. His hemoglobin A1c gradually worsened and glipizide (Glucotrol) was added 6 months ago. Since starting this medication he has had episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia twice per week. His weight has been increasing and his current BMI is 29 kg/m2. At the office visit today his hemoglobin A1c is 7.7%. He tells you that his uncle with diabetes recently died from heart disease. You discuss discontinuing glipizide since it is causing hypoglycemic episodes. He wants to remain on oral medications and does not want to start any medications that will make it harder to lose weight. Given his priorities, which one of the following would be the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?

## Options

**A.** No additional medications

**B.** Glyburide

**C.** Insulin glargine (Lantus)

**D.** Semaglutide (Rybelsus)

**E.** Sitagliptin (Januvia)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Combination treatment has been shown to be more effective than metformin alone in terms of lowering hemoglobin A1c, controlling weight, and improving blood pressure control. This otherwise healthy patient should be able to tolerate a hemoglobin A1c <7% and therefore remains above goal, so consideration of an additional medication is reasonable. It is important to consider the patient’s goals when determining which medication to add. Of the options listed, semaglutide has been shown to produce a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and weight and is preferred over sulfonylureas such as glyburide and DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin. The potentially high cost of semaglutide would need to be discussed with the patient. Insulin is always a reasonable option but would not meet the patient’s stated priorities.
