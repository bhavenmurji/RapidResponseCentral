# Question ITE-2023-142

Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial management for patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome?

## Options

**A.** A medial unloading knee brace

**B.** Exercise therapy

**C.** Intra-articular corticosteroid injection

**D.** Confirmation of the diagnosis with MRI

**E.** Referral for knee arthroscopy

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) involves pain around the patella during weight bearing on a flexed knee. PFPS is a clinical diagnosis and does not require imaging to make the diagnosis, although imaging may be indicated if other pathology is suspected. Exercise therapy is the mainstay of treatment. A medial unloading knee brace may be beneficial for symptomatic pain relief in knee osteoarthritis, but knee braces in general have poor evidence of benefit in PFPS. Intra-articular corticosteroids may be beneficial for pain relief in refractory cases but are not generally appropriate for initial treatment. Surgery may be indicated for refractory cases to correct patellar maltracking.
