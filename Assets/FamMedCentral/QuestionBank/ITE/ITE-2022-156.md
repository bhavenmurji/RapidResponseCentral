# Question ITE-2022-156

symptoms today. You last saw him 4 years ago and at that time his BMI was 24 kg/m2, his blood pressure was 124/70 mm Hg, and a lipid panel was normal. Today he tells you that he gained some weight and started smoking due to a stressful job. He is concerned about his risk for cardiovascular disease. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate screening test for this patient at this time?

## Options

**A.** Hypertension screening

**B.** An ankle-brachial index

**C.** A coronary artery calcium score

**D.** An EKG

**E.** Abdominal duplex ultrasonography

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for hypertension with office
blood pressure measurement in adults 18 years of age (A recommendation). Adults 40 years of age and
those 18 years of age with risk factors should receive annual hypertension screening. Less frequent
screening is recommended for adults 18–39 years of age without risk factors. The USPSTF found
insufficient evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) to recommend an ankle-brachial index (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-index.md|2023 05 Index]]) (I recommendation) or a coronary artery
calcium score (I recommendation) for cardiovascular screening, even in patients with traditional risk
factors such as male sex, older age, current smoking, and overweight/obesity status. Cardiovascular
screening with an EKG is not recommended (D recommendation). The USPSTF did not find adequate
evidence to suggest that adding a resting or exercise EKG helped guide treatment decisions to reduce
cardiovascular events in asymptomatic adults. It identified some evidence that small to moderate harms
may e...
