# Question ITE-2023-104

A 45-year-old male sees you for a routine health maintenance examination. You screen him for hepatitis C. A hepatitis IgG antibody is positive but on reflex testing there is no detectable viral RNA. When discussing the test results with him, he reports past use of injected opioids and intermittent use of cocaine. To his knowledge he has never been diagnosed with viral hepatitis. Regarding hepatitis C, the patient’s history and test results indicate

## Options

**A.** current infection with need for treatment

**B.** exposure less than 2 weeks prior to screening

**C.** a false-positive result

**D.** previous infection with immunity to future infection

**E.** previous infection with susceptibility to future infection

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Hepatitis C can be spontaneously cleared but patients with antibodies can still be reinfected. This patient has behaviors that put him at risk for exposure to hepatitis C. There is no viral RNA detected, so he does not have a current infection. Exposure to hepatitis C less than 2 weeks prior to screening would not explain a positive IgG antibody test. The patient’s test result is not likely to be a false positive, but rather indicates a previous hepatitis C infection given his history of intravenous drug use.
