# Question ITE-2024-134

## Question
A 65 -year-old male sees you for an annual health maintenance examination. His past medical history 
is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are both well controlled with medication. 
He had a myocardial infarction 10 years ago that was treated with angioplasty and he sees a cardiologist regularly. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day since age 16. His current 
medications include: 
Low-dose aspirin  
Hydrochlorothiazide  
Lisinopril (Zestril)  
Rosuvastatin (Crestor)  
He currently walks 2000– 3000 steps daily. In addition to recommending smoking cessation, you 
suggest a goal of more than 5000 steps daily. He tells you that his calves hurt when he walks more 
than 100 yards and he has to stop and rest before he can continu e. 
 If the suspected diagnosis is confirmed with testing, then which one of the following would be the 
most appropriate initial treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A supervised exercise program
**B)** Cilostazol
**C)** Pentoxifylline
**D)** Revascularization

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
According to guidance from the American Heart Association, a supervised exercise program to improve functional status, decrease symptoms, and improve quality of life is the first -line treatment for mild, non –limb-threatening peripheral artery disease. Aspi rin decreases cardiovascular risk but will not improve symptoms or quality of life. Cilostazol and pentoxifylline can help with symptoms but are second -line therapy. Revascularization can be considered but is not an initial treatment.
