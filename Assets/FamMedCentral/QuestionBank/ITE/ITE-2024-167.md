# Question ITE-2024-167

## Question
A 55 -year-old male presents to your office with a 3 -day history of pain, swelling, and tenderness in 
the right first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Four days ago he attended a celebration where he 
drank a large amount of beer and participated in a hot dog â€“eating contest.  
 
On examination he is afebrile and visibly in pain from his right toe. The right first MTP joint is 
warm, tender, and swollen. There is no streaking of the skin and no obvious abscess.  
 
Which one of the following laboratory tests would su pport the likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A C-reactive protein level
**B)** A CBC
**C)** A comprehensive metabolic panel
**D)** An erythrocyte sedimentation rate
**E)** A uric acid level

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient is most likely having a flare of gout. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in large joints, classically the first metatarsophalangeal joint. A patient with a gout flare typically has an elevated uric acid level. A C-reactive protein level and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate would likely be elevated in this patient, but elevations in those laboratory values are not specific for the likely diagnosis of gout. A CBC would potentially show elevated WBCs in this patient. However, leukocytosis is nonspecific and would not lead to the specific diagnosis of gout. A comprehensive metabolic panel likely would not provide insight into the likely diagnosis.
