# Question ITE-2023-163

A 56-year-old female comes to your office for an acute visit because she has had increased urinary frequency, thirst, and fatigue over the past month. Her medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria, and her current medications are extended-release metformin, 1500 mg daily; losartan (Cozaar), 50 mg daily; and rosuvastatin (Crestor), 10 mg daily. Her current BMI is 36 kg/m2, and you note that she has lost 5 kg (11 lb) since her last visit 4 months ago. A point-of-care hemoglobin A1c is 12%. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to add at this time? 60 62 ---

## Options

**A.** Basal insulin

**B.** A DPP-4 inhibitor

**C.** A GLP-1 receptor agonist

**D.** An SGLT2 inhibitor

**E.** A thiazolidinedione

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with symptomatic hyperglycemia associated with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. She is in a catabolic state, experiencing symptoms, and has a hemoglobin A1c 10%. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care in Diabetes, early initiation of insulin is recommended. Once the acute glucose toxicity has resolved with insulin treatment, this patient could be switched to a noninsulin agent. With her comorbid hypertension, albuminuria, and obesity, a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular and renal benefits would be the next best choices. DPP-4 inhibitors have intermediate efficacy for lowering glucose with neutral cardiovascular and heart failure benefit and a neutral effect on weight and progression of chronic kidney disease. Thiazolidinediones have high efficacy for lowering glucose but are associated with weight gain and increased risk of heart failure.
