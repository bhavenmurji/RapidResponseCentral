# Question ITE-2024-042

## Question
A 45 -year-old female presents for evaluation of a 3 -month history of left knee pain. She commutes 
by bicycle and is now finding it painful to cycle or even walk. On examination she does not have any 
deformity, and there is normal range of motion of the hips and knees. She has bilateral knee crepitus, pain on flexion of the left knee, and point tenderness that is noted 2 cm proximal to the left lateral 
joint line while flexing the knee.  
 
Which one of t he following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Iliotibial band syndrome
**B)** Lateral compartment osteoarthritis
**C)** Patellar tendinitis
**D)** Patellofemoral syndrome
**E)** Pes anserine bursitis

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient has iliotibial band syndrome, a common overuse injury in cyclists and runners. Pain occurs due to impingement of the iliotibial band over the lateral femoral epicondyle. The Noble compression test is diagnostic for iliotibial band syndrome and is considered positive if it evokes pain in the area of impingement, as in this patient. Crepitus occurs with osteoarthritis but is not specific, and this patientâ€™s history and the examination are more suggestive of iliotibial band syndrome. Patellar tend initis is more central, usually at the inferior pole of the patella. Patellofemoral syndrome causes diffuse pain without point tenderness. The pes anserine bursa is distal to the medial knee.
