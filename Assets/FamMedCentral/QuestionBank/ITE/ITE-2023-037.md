# Question ITE-2023-037

In patients with type 2 diabetes, medications from which one of the following classes have been shown to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease?

## Options

**A.** Biguanides

**B.** DPP-4 inhibitors

**C.** SGLT2 inhibitors

**D.** Thiazolidinediones

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes, as they slow CKD progression, reduce cardiovascular events, and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events and hypoglycemia and appear to slow CKD progression. Biguanides (e.g., metformin), DPP-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones have not been shown to reduce the progression of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes (SOR B).
