# Question ITE-2023-139

A previously healthy 58-year-old female sees you for evaluation of increased hair growth on her face and a weight gain of 18 kg (40 lb) over the past year. An examination is significant for a blood pressure of 155/98 mm Hg, a BMI of 34 kg/m2 with a truncal obesity pattern, striae on the sides of the torso and lower abdomen, marked hirsutism, and a rounded, swollen facial appearance. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Liver and renal function tests are normal, as are TSH, electrolyte, testosterone, and DHEA levels. A hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%. Which one of the following would be most useful to diagnose the condition suggested by this patientâ€™s presentation? 52 54 ---

## Options

**A.** A 24-hour urinary free cortisol level

**B.** 24-hour urinary metanephrines

**C.** ACTH stimulation testing

**D.** FSH and LH levels

**E.** Plasma renin activity testing and an aldosterone level

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with clinical findings strongly suggestive of Cushing disease, which is defined as the excessive production of adrenal cortical hormones. Options for confirmatory testing include 24-hour urinary free cortisol and overnight salivary cortisol levels. Metanephrines are used to diagnose pheochromocytoma. ACTH stimulation testing is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. FSH and LH levels test the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Plasma renin activity testing and an aldosterone level are useful in the workup of secondary hypertension to help diagnose hyperaldosteronism.
