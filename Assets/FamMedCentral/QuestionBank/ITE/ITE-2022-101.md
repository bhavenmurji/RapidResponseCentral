# Question ITE-2022-101

pressure that is worse on the right cheek and radiating into a maxillary molar. She recently recovered from a week-long cold and was getting better when she suddenly relapsed. Her symptoms have progressed over the last 12 days, culminating in a fever of 102°F last night. The patient reports a foul taste in the back of her throat. She has been drinking plenty of fluids, performing sterile saline sinus rinses twice daily, and using acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief. She has not had a cough except when clearing thick postnasal phlegm. She does not have itching of the eyes or nose, or a history of environmental allergies. On examination her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. She has a temperature of 38.9°C (102.0°F), a pulse rate of 100 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 14/min. She has no known drug allergies. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Supportive care for up to 2 additional days

**B.** Continued saline nasal rinses plus inhaled fluticasone (Flonase Allergy Relief) until

**C.** Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) for 5–7 days

**D.** Azithromycin (Zithromax) for 5 days, and follow-up if symptoms worsen or the fever

**E.** Levofloxacin for 28 days

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Most sinus infections are viral in origin, although there are specific circumstances in which antibiotics are
appropriate. This patient exhibits all of the diagnostic clues that are most reliable for determining a
bacterial etiology for the sinus infection: worsening symptoms with a new fever of 38.9°C (102°F),
duration >10 days, signs of double sickening, unilateral facial and tooth pain, and cacosmia (perception
of a foul odor). Since 2012, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the CDC, and Sanford have all
changed their recommendations to amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line antibiotic of choice due to
emerging antibiotic resistance. However, in practice, azithromycin is commonly prescribed despite
significant Streptococcus pneumoniae  resistance of approximately 40% or higher. One-third of bacterial
sinus infections are caused by S. pneumoniae , another one-third by Haemophilus influenzae , and the
remainder by Moraxella catarrhalis , group A Streptococcus , Staphylococc...
