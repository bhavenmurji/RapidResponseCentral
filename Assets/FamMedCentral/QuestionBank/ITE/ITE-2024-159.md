# Question ITE-2024-159

## Question
A 72 -year-old male with a medical history of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) 
of 30%, type 2 diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia comes to your clinic for follow -up. His 
most recent echocardiogram shows an improved EF of 55% –60%.  His current medications include 
the following:  
Carvedilol (Coreg), 25 mg twice daily  
Dapagliflozin (Farxiga), 10 mg daily  
Furosemide (Lasix), 20 mg daily  
Metformin, 500 mg twice daily  
Sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto), 97/103 mg twice daily  
Spironolactone (Aldactone), 25 mg daily  
The patient walks 2 miles daily and does not have any dyspnea. On examination his blood pressure is 
118/76 mm Hg, his pulse rate is 64 beats/min, and his respiratory rate is 12/min and regular. His 
lungs are clear bilaterally, and his heart sounds are regular with no S 3/S4 heart sounds or murmurs. 
His lower extremities show no edema. He has a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL (N 0.7 –1.3) and a 
hemoglobin A 1c of 7.0%. A urinalysis is neg

## Answer Choices
**A)** No change to his current regimen
**B)** Changing spironolactone to as -needed for edema
**C)** Discontinuing carvedilol
**D)** Discontinuing dapagliflozin
**E)** Discontinuing sacubitril/valsartan

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
According to the 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines, guideline -directed medical therapy should be continued in patients with heart failure with an improved or recovered ejection fraction (EF). This is ba sed on the TRED -HF trial that showed a relapse of 44% in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and an improved EF who discontinued pharmacotherapy compared with 0% relapse in those who continued pharmacotherapy. The recommendation for this patient would be to continue his current regimen. Referenc es Belkin MN, Cifu AS, Pinney S. Management of heart failure. JAMA . 2022;328(13):1346 - 1347.
