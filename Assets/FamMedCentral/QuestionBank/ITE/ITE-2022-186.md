# Question ITE-2022-186

of a fever, mild myalgias, and malaise followed by an expanding, erythematous, annular rash with central clearing on his thigh. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis for the rash?

## Options

**A.** Erythema migrans

**B.** Erythema multiforme

**C.** Nummular eczema

**D.** Pityriasis rosea

**E.** Tinea corporis

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Annular lesions can be a presentation of several different conditions. This patientâ€™s history of possible tick
exposure and current prodromal constitutional symptoms suggest acute Lyme disease. Erythema migrans
is the characteristic rash of acute Lyme disease. Erythema multiforme can be spontaneous, related to a
viral or Mycoplasma  infection, or associated with a medication reaction. Prodromal symptoms are
uncommon in limited erythema multiforme and the clinical context of this case suggests a different
etiology. Nummular eczema is an intensely pruritic, annular lesion that is not associated with constitutional
symptoms. Pityriasis rosea is thought to be viral in etiology and is usually otherwise asymptomatic. Tinea
corporis is a fungal infection and is not associated with systemic symptoms.
