# Question ITE-2023-124

A 32-year-old female contacts you through the patient portal regarding a 5-day history of symptoms consistent with acute rhinosinusitis. Which one of the following treatment recommendations would be in alignment with current recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America? 46 48 ---

## Options

**A.** Symptomatic treatment only

**B.** Amoxicillin

**C.** Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

**D.** Azithromycin (Zithromax)

**E.** Levofloxacin

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend observation and symptomatic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis until after 7 days, at which point antibiotics are recommended. However, the number needed to treat to achieve clinical cure is 17 and the number needed to harm is 8. About 64% of patients will reach clinical cure at 14 days without antibiotics. When antibiotic treatment is warranted, amoxicillin/clavulanate rather than amoxicillin alone is recommended as empiric therapy for children and adults. Macrolides such as azithromycin are not recommended for empiric therapy due to high rates of resistance. Levofloxacin or doxycycline are recommended as an alternative agent in adults who are allergic to penicillin.
