# Question ITE-2022-063

and bloating. She has had these symptoms for many years but has never discussed them in depth with a physician. A thorough history and physical examination are most consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). You order IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody and fecal calprotectin testing to rule out other conditions and both are negative. She has expressed an interest in nonpharmacologic measures as initial management of her IBS. Which one of the following should you recommend initially, given that it has the best evidence of benefit for her condition?

## Options

**A.** A gluten-free diet

**B.** A low-FODMAP diet

**C.** Soluble fiber

**D.** Prebiotics

**E.** Probiotics

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patient has diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and may benefit from validation
of her symptoms and a clear diagnosis that has several substantiated treatment options. A 2021 clinical
guideline from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) is based on a systematic review
performed by a committee of experts in this field. Based on this review, soluble fiber (but not insoluble
fiber) has good evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) for the alleviation of global IBS symptoms and is recommended strongly as a
first-line intervention. In contrast, a gluten-free diet has not been shown to be beneficial for IBS. A diet
low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) has
low-quality evidence supporting its benefit but merits a trial in patients who do not have an adequate
response to fiber supplementation. The ACG has not commented on prebiotics as a treatment for IBS. A
2018 systematic review concluded that while there are small individual studies sugges...
