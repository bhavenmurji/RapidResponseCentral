# Question ITE-2023-095

A 52-year-old male presents to your office because of increasing difficulty hearing conversations in social settings over the past 6 months. On examination the finger rub test is positive on the left ear. A Rinne test is positive on the left ear and negative on the right ear. A Weber test lateralizes to the left ear. Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of this patientâ€™s hearing loss?

## Options

**A.** Conductive hearing loss

**B.** Sensorineural hearing loss

**C.** Meniere disease

**D.** Ototoxic medication

**E.** Presbycusis

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient notes progressive hearing loss and has a positive finger rub test on the left, which indicates the left ear is affected. The Rinne test measures bone conduction compared to air conduction in which air conduction should be greater than bone conduction. A positive test indicates that bone conduction is greater and is indicative of conductive hearing loss. When the Weber test lateralizes to the bad ear, this indicates conductive hearing loss. If the Weber test lateralizes to the good ear, then this indicates sensorineural hearing loss. This patient has conductive hearing loss, not sensorineural hearing loss. Both Meniere disease and ototoxic medications cause a sensorineural hearing loss. Presbycusis is age-related hearing loss that is typically bilateral and sensorineural.
