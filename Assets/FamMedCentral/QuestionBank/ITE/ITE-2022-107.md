Which one of the following medical conditions is most likely the result of severely elevated triglycerides?

## Options

**A.** Asthma

**B.** Chronic kidney disease

**C.** Gallstones

**D.** Hypothyroidism

**E.** Pancreatitis

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as triglyceride levels ï‚³500 mg/dL, increases the risk of pancreatitis. It does not increase the risk of asthma, chronic kidney disease, gallstones, or hypothyroidism. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia should initiate therapeutic lifestyle modifications and should be treated with fibrates or niacin to help reduce the risk of pancreatitis.
