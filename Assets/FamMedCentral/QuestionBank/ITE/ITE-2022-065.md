# Question ITE-2022-065

uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Both the mother and infant are doing well. Her only complication during the pregnancy was an abnormal 3-hour glucose tolerance test. She managed her blood glucose with a combination of diet and exercise and delivered at 39 weeks gestation. The patient’s vital signs and a physical examination are normal today. Which one of the following should you recommend for this patient based on her history of gestational diabetes?

## Options

**A.** No glucose testing today, and initiation of metformin to prevent diabetes

**B.** No glucose testing today, and annual screening with a fasting plasma glucose level

**C.** No further glucose testing unless she becomes pregnant again

**D.** A 2-hour plasma glucose level using a 75-g oral glucose load

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A 2-hour, 75-g glucose tolerance test should be performed at 4–12 weeks post partum following a
pregnancy in which gestational diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) was diagnosed. This will identify patients who have developed
diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance. Women who have a history of
gestational diabetes have a sevenfold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to women
without a history of gestational diabetes.
This patient should not begin taking metformin because she may not be a candidate for treatment. Testing
is required to make the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose
tolerance.
If a patient who was diagnosed with gestational diabetes tests negative for diabetes mellitus on postpartum
screening, fasting glucose levels should still be assessed every 1–3 years regardless of pregnancy status.
With the next pregnancy the patient should have early screening with a 1-hour glucose tolerance test at the
time the preg...
