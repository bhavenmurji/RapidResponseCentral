# Question ITE-2022-132

event witnessed by his spouse. The patient reports that he has been easily fatigued and has not been able to walk as long as usual during the past few months. He recently saw his cardiologist and completed Holter monitoring but has not received the results yet. Laboratory studies during the ED visit were unremarkable. However, an EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 44 beats/min as well as pauses of more than 3 seconds, during which the patient reported dizziness. He says he wants to recover quickly so he can resume his regular activities. Which one of the following is the first-line treatment for the presumed diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Atropine

**B.** Cilostazol

**C.** Dopamine

**D.** Glucagon

**E.** Permanent pacemaker placement

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Sinus node dysfunction, also known as sick sinus syndrome, is defined by an abnormal initiation and
propagation of electrical impulses from the sinoatrial node, causing sinus pauses of more than 3 seconds,
sinus arrest, and bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats/min). Due to the resulting hypoperfusion, patients may
experience decreased tolerance of physical activity, palpitations, dizziness, easy fatigability, and syncope.
The diagnosis is made using heart rate monitoring. If symptoms are associated with exertion, an exercise
stress test should be performed. Patients not reaching a heart rate of at least 80% of their predicted
maximum (220 beats/min minus age) may have chronotropic incompetence. If the diagnosis of sinus node
dysfunction is confirmed, the first-line treatment is placement of a permanent pacemaker.
Medication control of sinus node dysfunction, such as with cilostazol, is an option for patients unwilling
to receive a permanent pacemaker, which is not the case in this patient...
