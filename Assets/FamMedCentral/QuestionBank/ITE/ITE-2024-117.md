# Question ITE-2024-117

## Question
A 55 -year-old female who is hospitalized for acute pancreatitis and alcohol intoxication expresses a 
desire for discharge against medical advice on day 2 of her admission. Which one of the following additional factors would represent a CONTRAINDICATION to immediate discharge in this case?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A current manifestation of mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome
**B)** A history of major depression with a past suicide attempt
**C)** An inability to demonstrate appreciation of her medical situation
**D)** A lack of health insurance
**E)** An unstable housing situation

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Discharges against medical advice comprise approximately 1% â€“2% of all hospital discharges and are challenging encounters to navigate. In such situations, communication, patient safety, and follow -up planning are of paramount importance.

In this patient scenario, an inability to demonstrate ap preciation of the medical situation and possible consequences of being discharged against the advice of the medical team would represent a contraindication to discharging the patient without further evaluation. For a patient who cannot demonstrate decision -making capacity, the next step is to consult an advance directive or surrogate decision -maker. If neither is available, the hospital ethics committee and medicolegal team should be contacted to provide further guidance. While moderate or severe alcohol withdrawal with associated mental status impairment likely would impair decision -making capacity, mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome alone would not contraindicate a discharge against medical advice. Active suicidal ideation may represent temporary impairment of decision -making capacity and psychiatric consultation is advised in such cases. This patient's history of depression with a past suicide attempt is not a contraindication to granting a request for discharge against medical advice. Neither a lack of health insurance nor an unstable housing situation would contraindicate a discharge against medical advice, although these factors should be considered in disposition and follow -up planning, with an ef
