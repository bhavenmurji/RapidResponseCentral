# Question ITE-2024-162

## Question
A 74 -year-old male with no significant past medical history comes to your office because of pain in 
his left lower extremity. The patientâ€™s leg was recently immobilized in a cast because of a fibular 
fracture. Doppler ultrasonography reveals a thrombosis of the iliac vein.  
 
Which one of the following is indicated for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** No anticoagulation
**B)** Anticoagulation for 3 months
**C)** Anticoagulation for 6 months
**D)** Anticoagulation for 12 months
**E)** Extended anticoagulation with no set stop date

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
This patient experienced a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that was provoked by his recent immobilization in a cast. According to the American College of Chest Physicians 2021 guidelines, the recommended duration of anticoagulation for an initial episode of a provoked DVT and pulmonary embolism is 3 months.
