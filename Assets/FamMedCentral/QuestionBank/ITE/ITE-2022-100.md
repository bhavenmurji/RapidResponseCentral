# Question ITE-2022-100

has many questions about potential treatments and outcomes. You discuss palliative care with her. Which one of the following is true regarding patients who receive palliative care?

## Options

**A.** Patients must have a life expectancy of 6 months or less to qualify

**B.** Care must be offered in person (outpatient or inpatient)

**C.** Patients may simultaneously undergo aggressive chemotherapy

**D.** Costs for palliative care are higher than for usual chronic disease care

**E.** Medicare and most commercial insurances provide bundled payments for palliative care

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Palliative care (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) can be offered to patients of any age with serious illness. It can be provided at any stage
of the illness and there are no life-expectancy criteria. Unlike hospice, patients receiving palliative care
may simultaneously undergo aggressive therapy. Palliative care can be offered in any setting, including
via telehealth. It has been shown that patients receiving palliative care incur fewer health care costs than
patients receiving usual care. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends early referral to palliative care,
as it improves patient care, increases patient satisfaction, and reduces costs. While Medicare covers
hospice care through bundled payments, there is no similar coverage for palliative care, which can limit
access. Commercial coverage for palliative care is inconsistent.
