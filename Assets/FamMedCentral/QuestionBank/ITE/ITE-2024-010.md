# Question ITE-2024-010

## Question
A 48 -year-old female presents to the urgent care clinic approximately 1 hour after spilling hot water 
on her left forearm while draining pasta. She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, and major depression. She is not allergic to an y antibiotics and is up to date on tetanus 
vaccination.  
 On examination her vital signs are normal. You determine that she has a partial -thickness (second -
degree) burn involving approximately a 4 Ã— 5- cm area on the posterior and lateral aspects of the lef t 
forearm.  
 In addition to oral medications for pain management and topical antiseptics, you should prescribe 
which one of the following?

## Answer Choices
**A)** No additional medications
**B)** Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)
**C)** Clindamycin (Cleocin)
**D)** Levofloxacin
**E)** Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim)

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
First-degree (superficial) and second -degree (partial -thickness) burns in adults can usually be managed in the outpatient setting. Management options include analgesia with anti -inflammatories or opioids if necessary, and topical agents to keep the burn area moist. Multiple agents can be used as a topical antiseptic, including silver sulfadiazine, honey, and aloe vera. Oral antibiotics are not indicated in the initial management unless there are obvious signs of infection.
