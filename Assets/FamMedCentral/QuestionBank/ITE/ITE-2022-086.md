# Question ITE-2022-086

severe, sharp, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and nausea that began shortly after eating dinner. On examination she is noted to have a low-grade fever with a positive Murphy sign. A laboratory analysis is notable for leukocytosis with a left shift and a mildly elevated total bilirubin level. A lipase level and liver transaminases are normal. Ultrasonography reveals several small gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid. After receiving intravenous fluids, pain management, and antiemetic treatment in the ED, her symptoms improve. In addition to intravenous antibiotics, the most appropriate next step in management would be to offer
