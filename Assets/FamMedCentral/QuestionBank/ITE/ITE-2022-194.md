# Question ITE-2022-194

diet. She is enthusiastic about vitamin supplements and asks you regularly about their benefits. Her laboratory chemistry profile demonstrates a persistent calcium level elevation at 10.9 mg/dL (N 8.5–10.2). You review her prescription medications and do not find any associated with hypercalcemia. You also review her calcium and vitamin D intake. Because you know about her tendency to take supplements, you consider other vitamins that may contribute to the hypercalcemia. Excessive intake of which one of the following would be the most likely explanation for these findings?

## Options

**A.** Vitamin A

**B.** Vitamin B1

**C.** Vitamin C

**D.** Vitamin E

**E.** Vitamin K

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Vitamin A intoxication can cause hypercalcemia. This includes analogs of vitamin A such as those used
to treat acne. The excessive intake of vitamin A is associated with multisystem effects that can include bone
resorption and hypercalcemia. Sources of preformed vitamin A include supplements as well as animal
sources such as liver, fish liver oil, dairy, and eggs. Vitamin A toxicity should be considered in
unexplained cases of parathyroid hormone–independent hypercalcemia. Vitamins B1, C, E, and K are not
associated with hypercalcemia.
