# Question ITE-2022-016

Once hemolysis is excluded, the most common cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is

## Options

**A.** alcoholic liver disease

**B.** biliary tract disease

**C.** fatty liver disease

**D.** Gilbert syndrome

**E.** Wilson disease

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be defined as an elevated indirect bilirubin level. While unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is most commonly seen in hemolysis, another common cause is Gilbert syndrome, which stems from a genetic defect that affects how the liver processes bilirubin. Alcoholic liver disease, biliary tract disease, fatty liver disease, and Wilson disease do not lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
