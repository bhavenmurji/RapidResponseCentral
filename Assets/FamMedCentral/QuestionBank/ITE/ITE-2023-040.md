# Question ITE-2023-040

9°C (105.6°F). In this patient with exertional heatstroke, which one of the following would be the most important initial step to reduce his core body temperature?

## Options

**A.** Administering acetaminophen

**B.** Administering aspirin

**C.** Immersing him in cold water

**D.** Initiating intravenous fluids

**E.** Transporting him to an emergency facility for treatment

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is comprised of a range of neurodevelopment conditions that affect social communication and interaction and involve repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Because early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes in affected patients and families, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening for ASD with standardized autism-specific screening tools, such as the M-CHAT, at 18 and 24 months; regular developmental surveillance at all visits; and an appropriate response to family and caregiver concerns. An 18-month-old who does not point to show interest would be concerning for an increased risk for ASD, and further evaluation is warranted. A child who does not respond to his or her name by 12 months of age or engage in pretend play by 18–24 months of age would also be at risk for ASD. Clapping hands when excited is a normal milestone for a 15-month-old, and clapping is not considered a repetitive activity in this context. Looking at the parent’s face to see how to react, particularly in a new situation, is also a normal milestone for a 24-month-old. 15
