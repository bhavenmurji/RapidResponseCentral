# Question ITE-2022-173

previously controlled with an albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) inhaler once or twice a month. After a 3-week trial of a tiotropium (Spiriva) inhaler his symptoms are better, but he is still having frequent episodes of coughing and dyspnea. He has been smoking 1–2 packs of cigarettes a day since age 13 and is not interested in quitting. On examination he is afebrile, his vital signs are stable, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. His lung sounds are diminished, and the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. His in-office peak flow is 300 L/min. You suspect he has moderate COPD and recommend pulmonary function tests but he declines. In addition to continuing tiotropium, which one of the following medications would you recommend adding to his current regimen?

## Options

**A.** An oral antibiotic

**B.** An oral corticosteroid

**C.** An inhaled corticosteroid

**D.** An inhaled long-acting β-agonist

**E.** A nebulized short-acting β-agonist

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the National
Initiative for Health and Care Excellence, and the American College of Chest Physicians all recommend
that in addition to smoking cessation, COPD should be treated initially with either a long-acting -agonist
(LABA) or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). If symptoms persist with either of those inhaled
medications then combination therapy should be initiated. An inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) can be added
to the LABA/LAMA regimen for triple therapy if symptoms continue. Long-term use of an ICS as
monotherapy is not recommended due to a slight increase in the incidence of pneumonia.
