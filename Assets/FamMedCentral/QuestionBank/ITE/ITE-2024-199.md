# Question ITE-2024-199

## Question
A 55 -year-old male with a medical history of GERD and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency 
department 2 hours after a sudden onset of intense epigastric pain. He takes naproxen almost daily for 
joint pain.  
 
On examination the patient is noticeably pale. His vital signs include a blood pressure of 90/60 mm 
Hg and a pulse rate of 125 beats/min. He is exquisitely tender to palpation in his abdomen, 
particularly at the epigastrium. There is no fluid wave or hepatomegaly. You do not note any obvious 
stigmata of chronic liver disease.  
 
Which one of the following tests should be performed to assist in the diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Aortic ultrasonography
**B)** Abdominal radiography
**C)** Abdominal and pelvic CT
**D)** Abdominal paracentesis
**E)** Exploratory laparotomy

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient most likely has a perforated peptic ulcer and the recommended test is CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Aortic ultrasonography is not productive in this case, as the patientâ€™s symptoms are unlikely to be caused by an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Abdominal radiography lacks the definition to visualize a perforated peptic ulcer. This patient's abdomen is not distended, and it is unlikely that abdominal paracentesis will yield the diagnosis or be therapeutic. Exploratory laparotomy is excessive and premature, as CT is diagnostic and less invasive.
