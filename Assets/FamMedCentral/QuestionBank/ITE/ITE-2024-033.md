# Question ITE-2024-033

## Question
Which one of the following community design features can be used to encourage people to walk more?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Frequently sought destinations (eg, school, work, stores) located at least 1 mile away from residential areas
**B)** High -quality public transit systems
**C)** High -speed roadways that route traffic through neighborhoods
**D)** Moving sidewalks and escalators

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Public transportation systems encourage users to walk to stops or through stations, and people are more likely to use public transportation if it is designed to be comfortable and convenient. In contrast, research has shown that people are less likely to w alk when everyday destinations are located more than a half -mile away from home. Safety concerns can be a barrier to walking, and high -speed roadways in neighborhoods increase pedestrian risk. Convenient alternatives, such as moving sidewalks and escalator s, also discourage walking.
