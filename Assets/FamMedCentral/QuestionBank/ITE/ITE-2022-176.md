# Question ITE-2022-176

nose, and cough for the past week. On examination he is noted to have bilateral conjunctivitis; dry cracked lips; a maculopapular rash; edema and erythema of his palms and soles bilaterally; and a nontender, enlarged, right anterior cervical lymph node. Which one of the following should be included in the evaluation of this patientâ€™s condition?

## Options

**A.** Chest radiography

**B.** Neck ultrasonography

**C.** Echocardiography

**D.** Neck CT

**E.** Cardiac MRI

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patient has the classic clinical manifestations of Kawasaki disease. All patients with Kawasaki disease
should undergo echocardiography due to the high risk of coronary artery dilation and aneurysm associated
with the disease. Chest radiography, neck ultrasonography, neck CT, and cardiac MRI are not
recommended in the evaluation of a patient with Kawasaki disease and would only be recommended if
another clinical indication for these studies were present.
