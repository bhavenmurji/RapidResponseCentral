# Question ITE-2024-017

## Question
A 32 -year-old male comes to your office because of a gradual onset of right ankle pain. He works in 
a warehouse and walks extensively during his 12 -hour shifts. The pain is located on the medial side 
of the ankle and worsens throughout his shift. His medical history is notable for well -controlled 
hypertension and a BMI of 39 kg/m2. 
 
On examination the patient has difficulty performing the single -limb heel raise test. You note a 
positive “too many toes” sign, as well as pes planus. You diagnose posterior tibial tendinopathy.  
 
In addition to arch supports, which one of the following should you recommend next?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A stretching program
**B)** Eccentric exercises
**C)** Oral corticosteroids
**D)** Corticosteroid injection
**E)** Percutaneous needle tenotomy

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Eccentric exercise is recommended over concentric exercise to treat posterior tibial tendinopathy. Because tendinopathy is not an inflammatory process, oral corticosteroids are not indicated. Corticosteroids injected into the tendon can provide some short -term relief of pain but have the potential to cause tendon rupture. Needle tenotomy is not a recommended treatment for posterior tibial tendinopathy. If the pain persists 3 –6 months after appropriate conservative management, surgical debridement of the tendon may be considered.
