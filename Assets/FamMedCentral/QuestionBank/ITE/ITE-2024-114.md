# Question ITE-2024-114

## Question
A 30 -year-old gravida 2 para 2 sees you for evaluation of bothersome palpitations. She is 2 weeks  
post partum and is breastfeeding the infant. Her medications include ferrous sulfate and sertraline 
(Zoloft).  
On physical examination she has a temperature of 36.7 °C (98.1 °F), a blood pressure of 130/82 mm 
Hg, and a respiratory rate of 12/min. Her heart rate is 120 beats/min with occasional extra heartbeats 
noted. Examination findings are otherwise normal. A CBC  and comprehensive metabolic panel are 
normal, and a TSH level is 0.2 μ U/mL (N 0.5 –4.0). An EKG reveals tachycardia and occasional 
premature atrial contractions.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial management?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Observation only
**B)** Discontinuing sertraline
**C)** Adding an antithyroid medication
**D)** Adding a β-blocker
**E)** A radioactive iodine uptake scan

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient has postpartum thyroiditis, a destructive triphasic condition that can occur after pregnancy. This patient is in the hyperthyroid phase, which is followed by a hypothyroid phase that can last 3 –12 months. The final stage is euthyroidism. β- Blockers are used for symptomatic treatment in the hyperthyroid phase. Observation only is not appropriate in this patient since she is symptomatic. While amiodarone and lithium can affect the thyroid, sertraline does not. Antithyroid medication is not indica ted. A radioactive iodine uptake scan is contraindicated in a patient who is breastfeeding.
