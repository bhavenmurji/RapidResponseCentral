# Question ITE-2023-044

A 42-year-old male sees you for a routine health maintenance examination. He has no symptoms, no high-risk behaviors, and no past medical history. The physical examination is unremarkable. He has had no health care screenings since a sports preparticipation evaluation at age 14. Which one of the following screenings should you recommend for this patient at this time?

## Options

**A.** Carotid stenosis

**B.** Glaucoma

**C.** HIV

**D.** Testicular cancer

**E.** Vitamin D deficiency

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adolescents and adults between the ages of 15 and 65 be screened for HIV (A recommendation). Screening for carotid stenosis and for testicular cancer is not recommended (D recommendation). The evidence for glaucoma screening and vitamin D deficiency is unclear and no recommendation has been made.
