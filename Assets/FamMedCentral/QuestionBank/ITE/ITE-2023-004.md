## Explanation

Dementia is a significant condition affecting 5 million adults and that number is likely to expand in the future due to the increasing number of individuals over age 65. The overall prevalence of dementia is around 5%, but it is 37% in those over age 90. Sixty percent to 80% of dementia is due to Alzheimer disease. The greatest risk factor for dementia is older age. Strong risk factors include diabetes mellitus, midlife obesity, a family history of dementia, a personal history of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, use of anticholinergic medications, apolipoprotein E4 genotype, and a low education level. Other potential risk factors that lack strong evidence include atrial fibrillation, smoking, head trauma, substance abuse such as alcohol use disorder, and medications such as benzodiazepines and proton pump inhibitors.
