# Question ITE-2024-068

## Question
An asymptomatic 20 -year-old female who is sexually active with a new male partner requests testing 
for sexually transmitted infections. She has had 2 sex partners and uses the subdermal etonogestrel 
implant (Nexplanon) for contraception. 
 
Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, she should be screened for which one of 
the following?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bacterial vaginosis
**B)** Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
**C)** Infection with genital herpes simplex virus
**D)** Infection with HPV
**E)** Infection with Mycoplasma genitalium

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
According to recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), females â‰¤24 years of age who are sexually active should be screened for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. A urine nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is recommended for screening. The USPSTF does not recommend asymptomatic screening for bacterial vaginosis or infection with Mycoplasma genitalium . The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for infection with genital herpes simplex v irus in asymptomatic adolescents and adults. HPV testing screens for cervical cancer but is not recommended for patients under 21 years of age.
