# Question ITE-2023-119

A 52-year-old male sees you for follow-up after a recent right-sided ischemic stroke. The evaluation in the hospital demonstrated an unremarkable cardiac workup, an LDL-cholesterol level of 110 mg/dL, and a right internal carotid artery stenosis of 45%. His blood pressure today is 120/75 mm Hg and an examination is notable for some residual right-sided facial weakness. His current medications are aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and hydrochlorothiazide. Which one of the following would be most likely to reduce his risk for a secondary stroke?

## Options

**A.** Atorvastatin (Lipitor)

**B.** Losartan (Cozaar)

**C.** Warfarin

**D.** Carotid endarterectomy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated significant reduction in risk for secondary stroke with high-dose statin therapy. The studies further demonstrated that an LDL-cholesterol goal <70 mg/dL was superior to targets of 90–100 mg/dL in preventing secondary stroke events. Data from RCTs and large meta-analyses show compelling evidence that blood pressure targets in patients with previous stroke should be similar to targets for other cardiovascular conditions, namely <130/80 mm Hg. There has been no benefit shown with lower blood pressure targets. Although angiotensin receptor blockers such as losartan are recommended for the treatment of hypertension, there is limited evidence of efficacy for secondary stroke prevention, so losartan would not be appropriate for this patient whose blood pressure is at goal. Use of warfarin in addition to aspirin does not provide any benefit and increases the risk for hemorrhage. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the greatest benefit for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was in asymptomatic patients with >70% stenosis, with other analyses demonstrating no benefit in patients with <50% stenosis. In symptomatic patients (e.g., ipsilateral TIA or nondisabling stroke), CEA is recommended in those with moderate (50%–69%) or severe (70%–99%) carotid artery stenosis.
