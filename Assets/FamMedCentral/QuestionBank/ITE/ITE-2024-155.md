# Question ITE-2024-155

## Question
A 71 -year-old male presents with an episode of reddish -brown urine. He has no other urinary tract 
symptoms. A urine dipstick is heme -positive  and a microscopic urine examination reveals RBCs too 
numerous to count. He has a 35 -pack -year smoking history.  
 
Which one of the following would be most appropriate to order at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Cytology
**B)** CT urography only
**C)** CT urography plus cystoscopy
**D)** Urinary tract ultrasonography plus cystoscopy
**E)** Urinary tract MRI plus cystoscopy

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient is at high risk for bladder cancer. Risk factors for urologic cancer in patients with hematuria include age â‰¥60 years, a >30 -pack-year smoking history, >25 RBCs/hpf on a single urinalysis, and a history of gross hematuria. Patients with hematu ria who are at high risk for bladder cancer should undergo CT urography plus cystoscopy. Cytology may be used as an adjunct if initial studies do not reveal a cause for the hematuria. CT alone may not identify bladder cancer. Urinary tract ultrasonography plus cystoscopy is adequate and more cost effective for patients who are at moderate and low risk. Urinary tract MRI is not recommended in this situation.
