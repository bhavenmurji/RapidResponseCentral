# Question ITE-2024-135

## Question
A 28-year-old nulligravida sees you for preconception advice. She and her husband would like to 
conceive in the next 6 months. She asks what she can do to prepare for pregnancy. She tells you that 
she has milk with breakfast and yogurt with lunch most of the  time.  
 
Which one of the following should you recommend?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A urine dipstick and culture with preemptive treatment
**B)** Calcium carbonate, 500 mg twice daily
**C)** Folic acid, 400 μg daily
**D)** Vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin), 1000 μg daily
**E)** Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), 2000 IU daily

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Evidence supports folic acid supplementation for all women prior to pregnancy and during the first trimester to prevent neural tube defects. There is no indication for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to conception. While calcium supplementation is often recommended, this patient’s diet provides sufficient calcium. There is uncertain evidence regarding vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin) supplementation in pregnant patients. Vitamin D supplementation with cholecalciferol is also often recommended during pregnancy, but the appropriate dosage is 600 IU daily.
