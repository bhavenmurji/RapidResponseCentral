# Question ITE-2024-154

## Question
A 45 -year-old male presents to your office for evaluation of acute penile pain. He has had painful 
erections for the past several days, and the current erection has lasted 5 hours. He has a history of 
sickle cell disease and diabetes mellitus. His only medication is daily metformin. On examination the 
patient appears quite uncomfortable and has a full erection with significant tenderness along the sides 
of the penile shaft.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Analgesia within 30 minutes
**B)** A penile blood gas measurement
**C)** Intracavernosal alprostadil (Caverject)
**D)** Intracavernosal phenylephrine (Vazculep)
**E)** Urgent evaluation by a urologist

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient is presenting with priapism, defined as an erection that is not associated with sexual activity and lasts â‰¥4 hours. Priapism may be ischemic or nonischemic. Nonischemic (high -flow) priapism is much rarer, stemming from an arterial fistula caused by trauma. Ischemic priapism typically presents with a painful, fully erect penis with a natural history of painful erections ranging from days to weeks preceding the acute presentation. Sickle cell disease is an important etiology of ischemic priapism. Other causes include other hematologic issues such as leukemia, and medications. Intracavernosal vasodilator agents and antipsychotics are more likely causes than phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors. This is a urologic emergency that requires emergent evaluati on and treatment by a urologist. Analgesic therapy is not the most appropriate next step for this patient. While a penile blood gas measurement can be used to distinguish between ischemic and nonischemic processes, urologic evaluation and treatment should not be delayed. Intracavernosal alprostadil is a common cause of ischemic priapism. Intracavernosal phenylephrine is used in the treatment of ischemic priapism after a urologist has performed several rounds of aspiration and reestablished oxygenated blood flow into the corpus cavernosum.
