# Question ITE-2023-190

A 68-year-old male with a past medical history of tobacco use and alcohol abuse presents with halitosis. On physical examination you note that he has thick white hyperkeratosis with a furry appearance on the anterior two-thirds of his tongue. Which one of the following should you recommend?

## Options

**A.** Serial observations with close follow-up

**B.** Increased fiber intake and regular tongue brushing

**C.** Oral fluconazole (Diflucan)

**D.** Topical corticosteroids

**E.** Referral for biopsy of the tongue

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This description is typical for a patient with retention hyperkeratosis of the filiform papillae, or “hairy tongue,” on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It causes a furry appearance with hair-like projections that become colonized with bacteria and can take on a dark pigmentation. This condition occurs in up to 11% of the population and is more common in older patients, with a 3:1 predilection for males. Tobacco and alcohol use, poor oral hygiene, a low-fiber diet, hyposalivation, mouth breathing, and immunosuppression are associated with hairy tongue. It can cause halitosis but otherwise lacks symptoms. Of the options listed, the most effective treatment is increased fiber intake and regular tongue brushing with toothpaste or hydrogen peroxide. Serial observations with close follow-up, oral fluconazole, topical corticosteroids, and referral for biopsy of the tongue should not be recommended for this patient.
