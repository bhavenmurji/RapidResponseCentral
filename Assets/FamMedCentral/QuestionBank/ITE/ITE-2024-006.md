# Question ITE-2024-006

## Question
Which one of the following medications has been shown to increase the resolution of metabolic 
dysfunction –associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Glyburide
**B)** Metformin
**C)** Pioglitazone (Actos)
**D)** , formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?
**E)** Vitamin D (cholecalciferol)

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Although lifestyle modification remains the first -line treatment of metabolic dysfunction – associated steatotic liver disease (formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), pioglitazone increases the resolution of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, especi ally in patients with advanced fibrosis. Pioglitazone may cause weight gain and should be avoided in patients with heart failure, and it carries a small risk for bladder cancer. Glyburide, metformin, repaglinide, and vitamin D (cholecalciferol) do not impr ove steatohepatitis or fibrosis.
