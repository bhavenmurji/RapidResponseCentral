# Question ITE-2024-122

## Question
A 3-month -old male is brought to your office by his parents with a 6 -week history of stridor that 
worsens when the infant is lying down and when he eats. On examination the infant appears well and 
is in no respiratory distress. His lungs are clear, and his growth curve is stable at the 85th percentile 
for both weight and length. You note s ubtle stridor with each inhalation that is more pronounced 
when he feeds.  
 
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bacterial tracheitis
**B)** Croup
**C)** Epiglottitis
**D)** Foreign body aspiration
**E)** Laryngomalacia

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This well -appearing child with chronic stridor most likely has the chronic condition laryngomalacia, in which the supraglottic structures collapse over the trachea during inhalation and result in the characteristic stridor. Symptoms typically begin between 1 and 2 months of age and are often chronic. Affected children are otherwise well. The stridor may be more pronounced with eating, and in some cases can lead to impaired weight gain or choking, cyanosis, or aspiration with feeding. As the child grows, the trachea will also grow and the condition will resolve. Bacterial tracheitis, croup, and epiglottitis are all acute, infectious causes of stridor. Foreign body aspiration is typically an acute presentation that is more common in older children who are able to grasp and manipulate foreign objects more easily.
