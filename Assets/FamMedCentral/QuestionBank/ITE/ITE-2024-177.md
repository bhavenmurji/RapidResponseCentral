# Question ITE-2024-177

## Question
A 59 -year-old female asks when she should consider screening for osteoporosis. Her last menstrual 
period was at age 53.  
 
According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which one of the following risk factors, if 
present, should lead to a calculation of osteoporosis risk with a screening tool and consideration of 
screening for osteoporosis now?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Low caffeine consumption
**B)** High alcohol consumption
**C)** Body weight >100 kg (220 lb)
**D)** A maternal aunt with a history of hip fracture
**E)** Nonsmoking status

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
In postmenopausal women younger than age 65, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for osteoporosis screening include assessing for osteoporosis risk factors (parental history of hip fracture, smoking, high alcohol consumption, or low body weight) and use of a clinical risk assessment tool if 1 or more risk factors are present.
