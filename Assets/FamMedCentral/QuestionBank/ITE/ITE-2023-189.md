# Question ITE-2023-189

You are considering a workup for resistant hypertension in a 58-year-old male due to a lack of response to medication therapy. Which one of the following is the most common cause of uncontrolled hypertension?

## Options

**A.** Hyperaldosteronism

**B.** Increased salt intake

**C.** Medication nonadherence

**D.** Obstructive sleep apnea

**E.** Renal artery stenosis >75%

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The most common cause of uncontrolled blood pressure is medication nonadherence, with an incidence of 83.7%. Hyperaldosteronism, high salt intake, obstructive sleep apnea, and renal artery stenosis are all possible causes of treatment-resistant hypertension, but they are less likely than medication nonadherence.
