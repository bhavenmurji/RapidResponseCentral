# Question ITE-2023-021

A 35-year-old female with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding is found to have a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (N 12.0–15.0). An elevated blood level of which one of the following biomarkers would be most consistent with iron deficiency anemia in this patient?

## Options

**A.** Ferritin

**B.** Hepcidin

**C.** Reticulocyte count

**D.** Total iron-binding capacity

**E.** Transferrin saturation

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Patients with iron deficiency anemia have an increase in total iron-binding capacity. All the other listed biomarkers, including ferritin and hepcidin levels, reticulocyte count, and transferrin saturation, are decreased in the setting of iron deficiency anemia. Other laboratory findings with iron deficiency anemia include a low mean corpuscular volume, a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin, a high red cell distribution width on a CBC, and a low serum iron level.
