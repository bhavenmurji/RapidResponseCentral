# Question ITE-2022-149

fever. Findings on CT are consistent with acute diverticulitis. The patient has a history of intolerance to metronidazole (Flagyl). If antibiotics are given, the preferred agent for this patient would be

## Options

**A.** amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

**B.** azithromycin (Zithromax)

**C.** cephalexin (Keflex)

**D.** ciprofloxacin (Cipro)

**E.** doxycycline

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The traditional approach to outpatient management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of acute diverticulitis consists of clinical diagnosis (with
or without imaging), antibiotics, and bowel rest. Two cohort studies found no difference in the
effectiveness of outpatient treatment of diverticulitis with amoxicillin/clavulanate or with metronidazole
plus a fluoroquinolone. Azithromycin is more appropriate for Campylobacter  or Escherichia coli  infections
that cause lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Cephalexin is not an appropriate treatment, and ciprofloxacin
monotherapy will not provide adequate coverage. Doxycycline is a treatment for watery diarrhea caused
by Vibrio cholerae  and Yersinia infections.
