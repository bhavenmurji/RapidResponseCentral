# Question ITE-2022-167

pooled lung cancer–specific mortality rate in the control group was 2.12%, the estimated lung cancer–specific mortality rate in the screened population was 1.72%, and the absolute risk reduction for lung cancer mortality was 0.4% (2.12% minus 1.72%). What is the number needed to screen to prevent one death due to lung cancer?

## Options

**A.** 5

**B.** 23

**C.** 47

**D.** 200

**E.** 250

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The absolute risk reduction (ARR) in this meta-analysis was 0.4%. The number needed to screen is the
reciprocal of the ARR. The number needed to screen would equal 1 divided by the ARR (1/ARR), or
1/0.004, which equals 250. based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) upon this meta-analysis, 250 individuals would need to be screened to
prevent one lung cancer death.
