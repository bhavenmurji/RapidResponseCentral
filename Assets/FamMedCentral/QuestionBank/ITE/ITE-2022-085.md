# Question ITE-2022-085

his father had an MI at age 45. The patient is a nonsmoker and does not take any medications. He states that he plans to start a regular exercise program, and asks for your advice regarding the best dietary approach for him. His vital signs are normal, including his BMI. Which one of the following would be most likely to reduce this patient’s cardiovascular risk?

## Options

**A.** Intermittent fasting (fasting for up to 16 hours each day, or eating only one meal on

**B.** A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet

**C.** A low-carbohydrate diet (Atkins diet)

**D.** A very-low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet (ketogenic diet)

**E.** A Mediterranean diet

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The Mediterranean diet has moderate to strong evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular
disease and associated mortality, preventing type 2 diabetes, decreasing overall mortality, and treating
obesity. Intermittent fasting has been shown to be effective in weight loss, although not clearly more
effective than overall calorie restriction, but a decrease in cardiovascular risk has not been shown.
Low-fat, low-cholesterol diets may lead to substituting foods with increased sugar and overall calories. A
low-carbohydrate diet has been shown to have more beneficial effects on lipid profiles than a low-fat diet.
Additionally, mono- and polyunsaturated fats are actually beneficial in cardiovascular health, so focusing
on a low-fat diet may be counterproductive. Low-carbohydrate diets can be useful to promote weight loss
and decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes, but their impact on cardiovascular disease is less clear. It
is recommended that less than 5%–10% of total calories s...
