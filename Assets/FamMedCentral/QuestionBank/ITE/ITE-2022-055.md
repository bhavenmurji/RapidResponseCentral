# Question ITE-2022-055

movements, confusion, vomiting, and fever, all of which started without warning a few hours ago. The wife reports that he has had a cough and upper respiratory symptoms recently, and he took an over-the-counter medication with dextromethorphan this morning. His usual medications include fluoxetine (Prozac), 30 mg daily for depression, and methylphenidate (Metadate CD), 50 mg daily for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. She checked his medication bottles and does not think he has taken extra doses. His vital signs include a blood pressure of 160/95 mm Hg, a heart rate of 116 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. A physical examination is remarkable for restlessness, anxiety, diaphoresis, and inducible clonus most prominent in the lower extremities. His lungs are clear and his neck is supple. He is alert and oriented to self only. Laboratory studies reveal a WBC count of 14,000/mm3 (N 4500–11,000) and a serum bicarbonate level of 20 mEq/L (N 23–30), and a urine drug screen is positive for amphetamines only. A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test is negative. The most likely cause of his symptoms is

## Options

**A.** an overdose of methylphenidate

**B.** an infectious process

**C.** malignant hyperthermia

**D.** serotonin syndrome

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome range from mild to life-threatening and typically appear minutes to hours
after ingestion of serotonergic medications. SSRIs are the most commonly associated class of medication
due to their widespread use. The Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria are the most commonly used
diagnostic tool. This patient has a history of serotonergic medication use, signs of inducible clonus,
agitation, and diaphoresis, as well as hyperthermia. It is likely that the addition of dextromethorphan
precipitated this episode. This patient’s history does not suggest an overdose of methylphenidate, and there
is little evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) in this scenario for a serious infectious process. Malignant hyperthermia generally appears
over a longer period of time and does not typically induce clonus. There are few, if any, choices for
medication therapy of concomitant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression that do not
increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, so patients on these reg...
