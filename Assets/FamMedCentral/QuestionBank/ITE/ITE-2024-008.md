# Question ITE-2024-008

## Question
Laser -assisted in -situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery is performed to treat

## Answer Choices
**A)** cataracts
**B)** closed -angle glaucoma
**C)** myopia
**D)** presbyopia
**E)** retinal detachment

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Laser -assisted in -situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery involves the surgical removal of an anterior corneal flap, stromal ablation, and replacement of the flap. LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) are considered the standard surgical procedures for the correction of myopia and other refractive errors, such as hyperopia and astigmatism. Ninety -eight percent of patients achieve a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Common complications include glare symptoms, dry eye, undercorrection, and overcorrection. Significant serious complications include keratitis, epithelial ingrowth, or flap dissection. Refractive surgery does not correct age -related farsightedness (presbyopia), which is due to loss of lens elasticity, rather than a corneal problem. LASIK is not used to treat cataracts, closed -angle glaucoma, or retinal detachment.
