# Question ITE-2023-055

Which one of the following medications commonly causes hyponatremia in the elderly?

## Options

**A.** Amlodipine (Norvasc)

**B.** Amoxicillin

**C.** Atorvastatin (Lipitor)

**D.** Escitalopram (Lexapro)

**E.** Spironolactone (Aldactone)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A possible side effect of SSRIs is hyponatremia, which is more pronounced in the elderly. This fact is particularly pertinent in elderly patients with poorly controlled psychiatric illness who are more inclined to psychogenic polydipsia, which also leads to hyponatremia. Amlodipine is known to cause peripheral edema, dizziness, and medication-induced hepatitis. Amoxicillin causes eosinophilia and ALT and AST elevations. Atorvastatin causes elevations in ALT, AST, and creatine kinase levels. Spironolactone causes hyperkalemia and hyperuricemia, but it is not known to cause hyponatremia.
