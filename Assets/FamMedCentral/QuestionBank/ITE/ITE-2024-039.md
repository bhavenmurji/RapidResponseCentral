# Question ITE-2024-039

## Question
A 32 -year-old female sees you to request breast cancer screening after learning that her 45 -year-old 
sister was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has no other known history of breast cancer. The patient 
does not have a family history of ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancers. Menarche occurred at 13 years 
of age and she has never been pregnant. On examination there is no nipple discharge or axillary lymphadenopathy and she has no palpable breast masses.  
 
Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, which one of the following should you 
recommend as the next step in evaluation?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Monthly breast self -examinations
**B)** Screening mammography
**C)** Screening breast ultrasonography
**D)** Genetic counseling

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), primary care clinicians should evaluate women individually for their family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers with a familial risk assessment tool. Patients with a posit ive risk score should be recommended for genetic counseling (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against teaching patients breast self -examination due to a lack of supporting evidence confirming a benefit of breast cancer detection. Neither screening mammography nor ultrasonography are recommended without anatomic abnormalities indicating further examination at this age.
