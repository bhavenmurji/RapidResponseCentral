# Question ITE-2024-168

## Question
A 32 -year-old female presents to your office because of a 2 -month history of fatigue and myalgias. 
She reports a 5- lb weight loss and bilateral joint pain in her hands and knees. She has had intermittent 
fevers to 101 °F with no cough, dyspnea, or abnormal urinary symptoms. Examination findings are 
normal. An erythrocyte  sedimentation rate is elevated at 35 mm/hr (N <20), and a CBC reveals 
leukocytosis and a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (N 12.0 –15.0). An antinuclear antibody titer is 
positive at 1:80, and anti –double -stranded DNA and anti -Smith antibodies are elevated. 
 
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Polymyalgia rheumatica
**B)** Psoriatic arthritis
**C)** Rheumatoid arthritis
**D)** Septic arthritis
**E)** Systemic lupus erythematosus

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient’s presentation is suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus, in which the diagnosis is confirmed by a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test and positive anti – double -stranded DNA and anti -Smith antibodies. Polymyalgia rheumatica usually occurs in older patients with bilateral joint pain and weakness in the shoulder joint who also have elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates but do not have a positive ANA test or other positive autoantibodies. Psoriatic arth ritis usually presents as a polyarthritis and is not associated with a positive ANA test. Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with morning stiffness and symmetrical polyarthritis in small joints. Septic arthritis typically has an acute presentation inv olving a single joint with findings of erythema, warmth, and leukocytosis.
