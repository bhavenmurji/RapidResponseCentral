# Question ITE-2024-064

## Question
A 68 -year-old male presents with dependent edema and an ulcer over the medial malleolus secondary 
to venous insufficiency. The dorsalis pedis pulse is intact.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate management of this patient’s edema and 
ulcer?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A nongraduated compression stocking with 10 –20 mm Hg pressure at the ankle
**B)** A graduated compression stocking with 30 –40 mm Hg pressure at the ankle
**C)** A graduated compression stocking with 50 –60 mm Hg pressure at the ankle
**D)** An Unna boot

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Graduated compression stockings are the mainstay of treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. The compression is generally highest at the ankle with decreasing pressures at the calf. While compression stockings with <20 mm Hg tension may be helpful for c omfort, they are not considered adequate for venous insufficiency. Insufficiency significant enough to cause venous ulcers should be treated with 30 –40 mm Hg pressure stockings, which have been shown to be effective for >90% of ulcers if a patient is 70% –80% compliant with usage. Varicosities with swelling and discomfort may be helped by 20 –30 mm Hg pressure compression stockings. Compression stockings with >50 mm Hg of pressure are not as well tolerated and are generally used in patients with lymphedema. U nna boots have significant variability of pressures and are not generally recommended for this condition.
