# Question ITE-2024-197

## Question
A 15 -year-old female is brought to your office in May with a 3 -week history of nasal congestion, 
sneezing, and itchy eyes. She reports that these episodes occur every spring and last about 6 weeks. 
She has been taking oral cetirizine (Zyrtec) with no improvement.  You initiate an intranasal 
corticosteroid.  
 The patient returns for follow -up 4 weeks later and says that she has seen some improvement but is 
dissatisfied with her progress. The patient and her parent ask about further steps in diagnosis.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A CBC
**B)** Skin allergen testing
**C)** Serum allergy testing
**D)** Chest radiography
**E)** Sinus CT

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
This patient most likely has seasonal allergic rhinitis that has not responded to empiric treatment. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is skin allergen testing. Serum allergy testing is more expensive and less specific than skin allergen testing. It also does not provide the immediate results of skin allergen testing. A CBC will likely show eosinophilia, given the patientâ€™s likely diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. However, this is a nonspecific finding. This patient likely does not have a true respiratory illness such as pneumonia, so a chest x -ray would not be appropriat e. Sinus CT likely will not lead to actionable management. It is also expensive and carries the risk for radiation exposure, which needs to be weighed carefully in a pediatric patient.
