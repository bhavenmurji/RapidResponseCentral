# Question ITE-2022-108

and a runny nose, but no fever. The childâ€™s symptoms are not progressing. The patient has a history of wheezing when he has mild respiratory infections. The only findings on examination are yellow nasal discharge and mild wheezing. The appropriate management with the LEAST amount of risk would be treatment for 10 days with

## Options

**A.** amoxicillin

**B.** montelukast (Singulair)

**C.** an antihistamine decongestant

**D.** an inhaled corticosteroid

**E.** an oral corticosteroid

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

For children up to 4 years of age who only have wheezing with respiratory infections, using an inhaled
corticosteroid (IC) daily when a respiratory infection develops reduces exacerbations and the use of
systemic corticosteroid therapy. It is uncertain if ICs affect growth, but they would be less likely to do so
than systemic corticosteroids. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for bacterial infections. Montelukast
is indicated for the prevention of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The use of antihistamine decongestant
preparations in children is not recommended due to potential side effects and minimal benefit.
