# Question ITE-2022-077

has had two myocardial infarctions in the past 5 years and has undergone stent placement. He is currently asymptomatic. His vital signs are stable and his blood pressure is well controlled. Laboratory studies reveal a normal hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile. In addition to high-dose statin therapy, his current medication regimen includes the following: Aspirin Carvedilol (Coreg) Chlorthalidone Clopidogrel (Plavix) Lisinopril (Zestril) Adding which one of the following would help to provide secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in this patient?

## Options

**A.** Azithromycin (Zithromax)

**B.** Colchicine (Colcrys)

**C.** DHA

**D.** Niacin

**E.** Omega-3 supplements

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The central role of inflammation in the progression of coronary disease is well recognized and the use of
an anti-inflammatory medication may improve outcomes in these patients. The low-dose colchicine
(LoDoCo2) trial evaluated colchicine, 0.5 mg daily, versus placebo in patients with chronic coronary
artery disease and found a 30% risk reduction in cardiovascular deaths, spontaneous myocardial
infarctions, ischemic stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization. It did not find any observable
difference with regard to new-onset atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, diabetes mellitus, or
pulmonary embolism. Of note, the trial excluded individuals with heart failure or renal impairment.
At one time, azithromycin had shown some evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease,
but subsequent trials did not show the same benefit. Studies of fish oil capsules that contain marine
omega-3 fatty acid supplements mixed with EPA/DHA formulations have failed to show cardiovascu...
