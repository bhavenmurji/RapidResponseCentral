# Question ITE-2023-140

According to the 2022 American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline, treatment to a blood pressure target of <135/85 mm Hg in adults who have hypertension reduces which one of the following?

## Options

**A.** All-cause mortality

**B.** Cardiovascular mortality

**C.** Risk of myocardial infarction

**D.** Risk of stroke

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The 2022 American Academy of Family Physicians clinical practice guideline recommends treating adults who have hypertension to a standard target of <140/90 mm Hg based on high-quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence showed that treating adults to a lower blood pressure target of <135/85 mm Hg further reduced the risk of myocardial infarction compared to the standard target, with a number needed to treat of 137 over 3.7 years. There was no benefit in mortality or stroke risk. Of note, treating to a lower target blood pressure does increase the absolute risk of serious adverse events by 3%, with a number needed to harm of 33 over 3.7 years. 54
