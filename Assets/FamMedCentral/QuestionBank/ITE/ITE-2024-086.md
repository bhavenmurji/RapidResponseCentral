# Question ITE-2024-086

## Question
A 78 -year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, ongoing tobacco use, and carotid 
endarterectomy presents to the emergency department with bloody diarrhea and severe lower 
abdominal pain. Which one of the following is the most likely dia gnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Angiodysplasia
**B)** Arteriovenous malformation
**C)** Colon cancer
**D)** Irritable bowel syndrome
**E)** Ischemic colitis

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
The differential diagnosis for the painful rectal bleeding in this patient includes inflammatory bowel disease, infectious colitis, hemorrhoids, and ischemic colitis. The patient's multiple risk factors for vascular disease place him at higher risk for isc hemic colitis. The differential diagnosis for painless rectal bleeding includes angiodysplasia, arteriovenous malformation, colon cancer, diverticular bleeding, and post -polypectomy bleeding. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause rectal bleeding.
