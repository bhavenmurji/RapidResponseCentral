# Question ITE-2022-172

recent onset of postural dizziness and lightheadedness. An evaluation reveals a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension with no underlying etiology identified. After an unsuccessful trial of managing her symptoms with nonpharmacologic measures, she returns to discuss additional treatment options. Which one of the following oral medications would be the preferred initial treatment?

## Options

**A.** Atomoxetine (Strattera)

**B.** Clonidine

**C.** Midodrine

**D.** Phenylephrine

**E.** Pyridostigmine (Mestinon)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Treatment of orthostatic hypotension begins with identifying and addressing the underlying cause(s) when
possible. This may include correcting a reversible medical condition or discontinuing an offending
medication. Nonpharmacologic measures should be initiated next and typically include increasing fluid and
sodium intake, improving physical fitness, wearing compression garments, and avoiding hot and humid
environments. When additional treatment is needed, first-line medication options include midodrine or
droxidopa, which act by increasing peripheral vascular resistance. Off-label use of atomoxetine or
pyridostigmine may be considered as adjunct therapy but these medications are not part of the initial
management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]). The -antagonist clonidine typically causes a decrease in blood pressure through central
action on the sympathetic nervous system. In patients with autonomic dysfunction, however, clonidine can
increase venous return without a blood pressureâ€“lowering effect and therefore impr...
