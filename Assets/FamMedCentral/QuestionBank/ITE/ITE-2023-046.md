# Question ITE-2023-046

A 55-year-old male sees you because of heartburn and dysphagia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows moderately severe esophagitis. Which one of the following is the most appropriate long-term pharmacologic management for this condition?

## Options

**A.** Famotidine (Pepcid), 10 mg daily

**B.** Metoclopramide (Reglan), 10 mg before meals

**C.** Omeprazole, 40 mg daily

**D.** Sucralfate (Carafate), 1 g twice daily

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Patients with moderately severe esophagitis require ongoing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to manage symptoms. There is a nearly 100% recurrence of symptoms at 6 months if a PPI is stopped. Lifelong omeprazole use would be the best choice for this patient. PPIs are recommended over H2-blockers such as famotidine for maintenance and healing of erosive esophagitis. Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide are not recommended for GERD unless gastroparesis is also present. Sucralfate is not recommended for GERD except in the case of pregnancy.
