# Question ITE-2022-147

started training for a marathon. The pain is most severe immediately upon standing in the morning and then gradually improves somewhat after ambulation. It worsens again if he stands after sitting for a period of time or after excessive walking or running. Which one of the following is supported by evidence as a first-line intervention to provide pain relief for this condition?

## Options

**A.** Night splints

**B.** Plantar fascia stretching exercises

**C.** Acupuncture

**D.** Extracorporeal shock wave therapy

**E.** Platelet-rich plasma injection

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient most likely has plantar fasciitis. Stretching exercises are effective in reducing heel pain caused
by plantar fasciitis. Clinical trials regarding pain relief with the use of night splints are conflicting and thus
inconclusive. The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons does not advocate for or against
acupuncture to treat plantar fasciitis, as the studies available are of low quality. Extracorporeal shock wave
therapy is only recommended after conservative therapies fail and for chronic plantar fasciitis. Platelet-rich
plasma injections may be indicated in refractory plantar fasciitis but are not considered first-line therapy
for an acute presentation.
