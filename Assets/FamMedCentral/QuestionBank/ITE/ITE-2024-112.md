# Question ITE-2024-112

## Question
A 45 -year-old female sees you to discuss chronic insomnia. She typically falls asleep fairly easily but 
awakens throughout the night and has difficulty falling back asleep. Her episodes of wakefulness are 
not caused by restless legs, pain, urinary frequenc y, or snoring. She has tried cognitive behavioral 
therapy and melatonin without improvement and would like to try a prescription medication that is 
not habit forming.  
 
Which one of the following medications has the best evidence of efficacy and safety to h elp improve 
her insomnia?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Diphenhydramine
**B)** Doxepin (Silenor)
**C)** Quetiapine (Seroquel)
**D)** Temazepam (Restoril)
**E)** Trazodone

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Low-dose doxepin has the best evidence of efficacy and safety to address this patient’s chronic insomnia with impaired sleep maintenance. Dosages of 3 –6 mg nightly have been found to increase sleep efficiency and total sleep time. At this low dosage the adverse effect and safety profile was similar to placebo, even in older adults. It is thought that doxepin’s mechanism of action is via an antihistamine effect, and the patient should be counseled about the possibility of anticholinergic side effects such as next-day sleepiness. Diphenhydramine, a strong antihistamine, is typically much more sedating and is associated with other anticholinergic side effects. It is not recommended for routine use for insomnia. The antipsychotic quetiapine is sedating but should not be used in the absence of a psychiatric condition such as bipolar disorder. Benzodiazepines such as temazepam are sedating and can improve sleep onset but carry a significant risk for physical dependence, and long -term use is not recommended. The antidepressant trazodone is often used off -label to treat insomnia but evidence for this approach is weak and it should not be recommended as first -line therapy.
