# Question ITE-2024-026

## Question
A 53 -year-old female sees you for follow -up of an emergency department (ED) visit for abdominal 
pain. CT of the abdomen in the ED did not identify the cause of her pain but did reveal a 3- cm 
homogeneous right adrenal mass. Her abdominal pain has since reso lved.  
 
Her medical history includes stage 2 hypertension, prediabetes, menopause, and moderate obesity 
with a BMI of 35 kg/m2. She does not have any history of malignancy and is up to date on 
mammography and colon cancer screenings.  
 
According to the Ameri can College of Radiology and the American Association of Clinical 
Endocrinology, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step regarding this 
patientâ€™s adrenal mass?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Reassurance and no further evaluation unless symptoms develop
**B)** Repeating CT with adrenal protocol in 1 year
**C)** Ordering a 1 -g dexamethasone suppression test and, if normal, repeating CT imaging in 6 months
**D)** visit for abdominal pain. CT of the abdomen in the ED did not identify the cause of her pain but did reveal a 3- cm homogeneous right adrenal mass. Her abdominal pain has since reso lved. Her medical 
**E)** Ordering adrenal MRI and biochemical testing for evidence of adrenal hyperfunctioning

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
As the number of cross -sectional imaging studies has increased, so have incidental findings. This often creates a dilemma for primary care physicians as they guide their patients toward the most appropriate follow -up of these findings. Adrenal gland incide ntalomas are particularly common and concerning as even benign lesions may have hormonal activity. The most current recommendations from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the American College of Radiology suggest that all patients with masses >1 cm should be tested for autonomous cortisol secretion and that patients without a history of malignancy who have lesions >2 cm and <4 cm on initial imaging should have adrenal -specific imaging via either CT or MRI. This patientâ€™s history of hype rtension, obesity, and prediabetes would also result in a recommendation for testing to rule out hyperaldosteronism. Reassurance or repeating the study in 1 year would not be appropriate for this particular lesion. Biochemical studies for pheochromocytoma are unnecessary in this patient unless there is clinical suspicion or the dedicated study demonstrates characteristic s that make the condition likely. Biopsy of the gland would be appropriate only if suspicious characteristics were identified on adrenal -specific imaging and would generally be done as a surgical procedure, not a needle biopsy.
