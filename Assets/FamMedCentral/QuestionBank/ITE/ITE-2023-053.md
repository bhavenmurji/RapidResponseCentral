# Question ITE-2023-053

A 39-year-old male with no known previous medical history sees you for follow-up of recently diagnosed depression. He works as a home renovation contractor and does not smoke. A physical examination is normal other than a BMI of 36 kg/m2. Laboratory studies reveal a normal TSH level and a hemoglobin level of 17.4 g/dL (N 13.3â€“16.2). You suspect that which one of the following is a cause of his polycythemia? 20 22 ---

## Options

**A.** Alcohol use

**B.** Hemochromatosis

**C.** Hereditary spherocytosis

**D.** Lead exposure

**E.** Obstructive sleep apnea

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Secondary polycythemia, or elevation of red blood cells, can have multiple causes. Conditions that affect oxygenation such as obstructive sleep apnea may cause secondary polycythemia. While hemochromatosis causes elevation of iron levels, it does not typically cause polycythemia. Hereditary spherocytosis causes hemolytic anemia. Smoking cigarettes is a common cause of secondary polycythemia, but alcohol use is often associated with macrocytic anemia. This patient may be at risk for lead toxicity, which can lead to anemia.
