# Question ITE-2023-036

A 24-year-old male presents for evaluation of a soft-tissue mass on his arm. Which one of the following features, if present, should prompt further evaluation with advanced imaging?

## Options

**A.** Diameter 5 cm

**B.** Fluctuant texture

**C.** Lack of tenderness with palpation

**D.** Persistent, slow growth over several years

**E.** Superficial location (above the fascia)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Soft-tissue masses that are 5 cm in diameter carry a higher risk of malignancy and should prompt further evaluation with advanced imaging. Other features that raise concern for possible malignancy include rapid growth, sudden presentation without explanation, and lesions that are firm, deep, and adhere to surrounding structures. Both benign and malignant masses can be painless, but a lack of tenderness with palpation alone would not prompt the need for advanced imaging. Advanced imaging would also not be necessary for a mass that has a fluctuant texture, has grown persistently and slowly over several years, or is superficially located (above the fascia).
