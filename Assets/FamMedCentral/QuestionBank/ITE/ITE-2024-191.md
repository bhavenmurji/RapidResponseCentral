# Question ITE-2024-191

## Question
A 48 -year-old female presents to your office because of an erythematous rash on her left posterior 
calf and right posterior thigh (shown below). Five days ago she was stung by wasps in those 
locations. The stings were initially associated with intense pain  and small areas of erythema that have 
since expanded to approximately 10- cm erythematous patches surrounding the original sting sites.  
 On examination there are erythematous patches on her left posterior calf and right posterior thigh with warmth, indurat ion, and tenderness to palpation. She does not have any fevers or chills. The 
examination findings are otherwise within normal limits.  
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Topical neomycin/polymyxin B/pramoxine (Neosporin)
**B)** Oral cephalexin
**C)** Oral diphenhydramine
**D)** Oral prednisone
**E)** Oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim)

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient is experiencing a large local reaction to an insect sting, occurring between a few days to 1 week after the initial sting. This occurs in about 19% of reactions and carries a 5% –10% risk for a systemic reaction in subsequent exposures. The tre atment is prednisone, 40 –60 mg daily for 3 –5 days. This is not an infection but rather a reaction to the Hymenoptera sting, so oral or topical antibiotics are not indicated. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine are useful for pruritus but are not a treat ment for the reaction. Referenc e Herness J, Snyder MJ, Newman RS. Arthropod bites and stings. Am Fam Physician . 2022;106(2):137 -147.
