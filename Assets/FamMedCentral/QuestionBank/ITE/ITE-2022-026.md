# Question ITE-2022-026

few days she has had itching of her palms and soles that has been quite bothersome. She has tried moisturizer with no improvement. A physical examination is unremarkable with no rashes, erythema, or warmth of the palm and soles. The patient otherwise feels well. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time?

## Options

**A.** A low-potency corticosteroid cream

**B.** Tacrolimus topical (Protopic)

**C.** Cetirizine (Zyrtec Allergy)

**D.** Bile acid levels

**E.** A BUN/creatinine ratio

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) presents with pruritus of the palms and soles with or without
jaundice along with an elevation in serum bile acid concentrations. ICP, which is most common in the late
second and/or third trimester, can cause significant risk to the fetus, including fetal death, and is therefore
treated aggressively with ursodeoxycholic acid and often early delivery. Corticosteroid creams, tacrolimus,
and cetirizine are not appropriate treatments for ICP. Kidney function tests such as a BUN/creatinine ratio
would not be initially appropriate in this case.
