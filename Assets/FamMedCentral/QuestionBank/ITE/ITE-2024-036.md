# Question ITE-2024-036

## Question
A 62 -year-old female sees you for follow -up of bilateral lower extremity edema that worsens 
throughout the day. A BNP level, TSH level, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, chest x -ray, 
EKG, and lower extremity venous ultrasound have all been normal.  
 
Which one of the following diagnoses should you consider in this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Celiac disease
**B)** Cushing syndrome
**C)** Lyme disease
**D)** Obstructive sleep apnea
**E)** Raynaud disease

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
Obstructive sleep apnea is an increasingly recognized possible etiology of lower extremity edema and should be considered during the evaluation of this patient. While the exact pathophysiology is unknown, nocturnal hypoxemia is thought to lead to increased sympathetic tone resulting in systemic hypertension. This nocturnal hypoxemia can lead to neuroendocrine activation and salt and water retention. Celiac disease, Cushing syndrome, Lyme disease, and Raynaud disease are not associated with lower extremity e dema.
