# Question ITE-2023-169

Which one of the following tests should you obtain in a patient with lichen planus?

## Options

**A.** Antihistone antibodies

**B.** Hepatitis C antibody

**C.** HIV antibody

**D.** Sjögren syndrome–related antigen A (Ro) and Sjögren syndrome–related antigen B (La) antibodies

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Lichen planus is a disorder of unknown etiology affecting the skin, genitals, oral cavity, scalp, nails, and esophagus. Patients with lichen planus have a higher (up to sixfold) incidence of hepatitis C virus infection. Hence, screening for hepatitis C should be performed in patients with lichen planus even though the cause-and-effect relationship between hepatitis C and lichen planus is unknown. 65 Antihistone antibodies are present in patients with medication-induced lupus erythematosus. HIV antibody is used in screening for HIV infection. Sjögren syndrome–related antigen A (Ro) and Sjögren syndrome–related antigen B (La) antibodies are present in patients with Sjögren syndrome.
