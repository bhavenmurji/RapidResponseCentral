# Question ITE-2024-174

## Question
A 32 -year-old female presents to your office because of a 2 -month history of painful intercourse and 
vaginal dryness. She is 1 year post partum and started combined oral contraceptives 4 months ago. 
She is no longer breastfeeding and desires continued cont raception. Her menstrual cycles have been 
regular, and she has not had any vaginal discharge. She reports intermittent dysuria and frequency, 
but no urinary incontinence. The pelvic examination is within normal limits and her symptoms are 
not reproduced on  examination. A urine pregnancy test is negative, and a urinalysis is within normal 
limits.  
 Which one of the following would most likely alleviate this patientâ€™s symptoms?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Switching to a levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)
**B)** Trigger point injections
**C)** OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)
**D)** Cognitive behavioral therapy
**E)** Myofascial pelvic physical therapy

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
This patient has dyspareunia, and the most likely etiology is vaginal dryness related to her use of combined oral contraceptives. The levonorgestrel IUD has not been associated with vaginal dryness, and changing her contraception would likely alleviate her symptoms and provide ongoing desired contraception. She can use vaginal lubricants or moisturizers for vaginal dryness. She does not meet the diagnostic criteria for vulvodynia, vaginismus, or myofascial pelvic pain syndrome. Trigger point injections, cognitive behavioral therapy, and myofascial pelvic physical therapy are possible treatments for vaginismus or vulvodynia. OnabotulinumtoxinA is used off -label as a treatment option for interstitial cystitis or female chronic pelvic pain but only after other treatments have failed.
