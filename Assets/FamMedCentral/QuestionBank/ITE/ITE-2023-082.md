# Question ITE-2023-082

A 72-year-old male presents to your office because of right hip pain and difficulty walking. He notes that the pain is relieved by activity and is worse at night. You obtain a plain film of the hip (shown below). An elevation in which one of the following laboratory results would confirm the diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Alkaline phosphatase

**B.** Calciferol

**C.** Creatine phosphokinase

**D.** Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase

**E.** Phosphorus

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with characteristic symptoms and plain film radiographic findings of Paget disease of bone, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level would confirm the diagnosis. Paget disease is a benign skeletal condition characterized by focal areas of increased bone turnover and disorganized bone formation. It occurs most commonly in older men and pain is the most common symptom. Abnormalities may occur in any bone, but the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones are most often affected. The radiograph in this scenario exhibits typical features of Paget disease with areas of osteosclerosis, bone deformity, bone enlargement, and pronounced trabeculae. Generally, Paget disease is not associated with metabolic disease, although polyostotic disease (multiple focal areas involved) may cause increased urinary calcium excretion and hypercalcemia in rare cases. Calciferol (vitamin D) and phosphorus levels would not be elevated in this condition. Elevation of the creatine phosphokinase level is associated with muscle, rather than bone, disease. The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level is not elevated in Paget disease of bone but may be elevated in liver disease, which can also increase alkaline phosphatase levels.
