# Question ITE-2022-097

has a history of well controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension and he currently takes metformin and lisinopril (Zestril). He also has a history of recurrent skin abscesses, which have responded well to oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim). He has occasional chills but has not had a fever. On examination his vital signs are normal and you note the presence of a CBC are pending. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Options

**A.** Continue current management and follow up in 48 hours

**B.** Perform incision and drainage, obtain a culture, and start sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim

**C.** Perform incision and drainage, obtain a culture, and start oral linezolid (Zyvox)

**D.** Perform incision and drainage, obtain a culture, and start sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Incision and drainage of an abscess along with MRSA antibiotic coverage is recommended for all abscesses
greater than 2×2 cm. Incision and drainage of an abscess is almost always indicated and is a cornerstone
of treatment. A wound culture with antibiotic sensitivity must be obtained in all cases to guide therapy.
MRSA is the most common causative pathogen, so an antibiotic that provides coverage against MRSA,
such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, doxycycline, or clindamycin, should be used as an empiric
first-line agent for treatment of a skin abscess, pending culture results. Additional anaerobic coverage is
recommended when an abscess is located in the perirectal area or when an abscess occurs in an area where
tissue ischemia is likely.
Continuing current management (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) with follow-up in 48 hours is not recommended due to the potential for
expansion of the abscess in patients with diabetes mellitus (SOR A). When an abscess is less than 2×2 cm,
incision and drainage is often the only re...
