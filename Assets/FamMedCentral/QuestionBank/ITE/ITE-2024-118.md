# Question ITE-2024-118

## Question
A 55 -year-old female sees you because of weakness in the left leg. She has a history of hypertension, 
type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis of the knees, and degenerative disk disease of the cervical and lumbar 
spines. An examination is notable for focal weakness on dorsiflexion of her left foot and extension of her toes, and a neurologic examination is otherwise normal.  
 
Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Cervical myelopathy
**B)** Diabetic neuropathy
**C)** L4 nerve root impingement
**D)** Peroneal nerve compression
**E)** Tarsal tunnel syndrome

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
The most common cause of foot drop is a compression neuropathy of the peroneal (also known as common fibular) nerve, most often at the fibular head just distal to the lateral knee. Tight -fitting braces and casts as well as prolonged leg crossing can cause this neuropathy. Cervical myelopathy may cause lower extremity weakness, but it may also cause numbness and upper motor neuron findings such as hyperreflexia. Diabetic neuropathy is typically bilateral and symmetric and rarely causes motor weakness. L5, but not L4, nerve root impingement can also cause foot drop. Tibial nerve compression at the tarsal tunnel causes pain into the lateral midfoot, but it does not lead to foot drop.
