# Question ITE-2024-145

## Question
A 62 -year-old male who currently receives chemotherapy for colon cancer presents to the emergency 
department with a 1 -week history of worsening nausea and vomiting. He has been vomiting all oral 
intake for the past day, and he has not had a bowel movement in the past week. He reports severe, 
diffuse, crampy, intermittent abdominal pain that improves after vomiting. He has not had any fevers or chills. The physical examination is significant for abdominal distention, minimal bowel sounds, 
and diffuse tenderness.  
 
Which one of the following studies would be the most appropriate next step in evaluation?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
**B)** CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast
**C)** A PET/CT scan
**D)** A HIDA scan
**E)** Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
This patientâ€™s presentation is consistent with a malignant bowel obstruction, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is useful for determining if any surgical interventions are warranted. Ultrasonography typically does not yield useful information due to the amount of bowel gas present during an obstruction. A PET/CT scan would not be indicated to evaluate for the etiology of a bowel obstruction in an acute situation. A HIDA scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) would be useful if biliary obstruction or gallbladder disease were suspected, but these are not helpful in the evaluation of a malignant bowel obstruction.
