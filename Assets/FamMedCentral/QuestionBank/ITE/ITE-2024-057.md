# Question ITE-2024-057

## Question
A 23 -year-old female presents to your office for evaluation of amenorrhea. A pregnancy test is 
positive, and you determine that she is at 6 weeks’ gestation based on her last menstrual period. She 
has a history of acne, allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and anxiety. The patient’s current 
medications include the following: 
Adapalene 0.1% gel (Differin Gel) daily  
Famotidine (Pepcid), 20 mg as needed 
Fluticasone propionate (Flonase), 50 μg daily  
Hydroxyzine (Vistaril), 25 mg as needed 
Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX), 17 g as needed  
Which one of the patient’s current medications should be discontinued at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Adapalene
**B)** Famotidine
**C)** Fluticasone propionate
**D)** Hydroxyzine
**E)** Polyethylene glycol

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Family physicians should be familiar with medications contraindicated in pregnancy that are commonly used by women of reproductive age. Topical adapalene, along with other retinoids, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to lack of safety data and known harm from oral formulations. Famotidine, fluticasone propionate, hydroxyzine, and polyethylene glycol are generally considered safe in all trimesters of pregnancy.
