# Question ITE-2023-091

A 63-year-old male presents to your office because of intermittent chest pain with exertion. He has been building a new deck and noted the onset of chest pain following particularly intense workdays. He reports that the pain always resolves with rest, and he has not noticed any lower extremity edema or difficulty breathing. His past medical history is notable only for hypertension and coronary artery disease diagnosed 3 years ago. His current medications include atorvastatin (Lipitor), 40 mg daily; lisinopril (Zestril), 10 mg daily; and aspirin, 81 mg daily. His vital signs include a weight of 80 kg (176 lb), a height of 178 cm (70 in), a blood pressure of 138/78 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 80 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 12/min, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. A physical examination is normal. An EKG reveals normal sinus rhythm without ST-segment, T-wave, or Q-wave abnormalities. In addition to prescribing as-needed, immediate-release nitroglycerin, which one of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?

## Options

**A.** Diltiazem (Cardizem LA), 180 mg daily

**B.** Ezetimibe (Zetia), 10 mg daily

**C.** Isosorbide mononitrate, 30 mg daily

**D.** Metoprolol succinate (Toprol-XL), 100 mg daily

**E.** Ranolazine (Ranexa), 500 mg twice daily

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient has coronary artery disease with symptoms of angina but without symptoms of heart failure. In addition to lifestyle modifications, management of blood pressure and lipids, and antiplatelet therapy, the management of coronary artery disease includes pharmacotherapy for the symptoms of angina. Immediate-release nitroglycerin is appropriate for the short-term relief of angina. However, -blockers are first-line treatments for long-term relief. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be used in addition to -blockers if symptoms are not controlled with a -blocker alone or if -blockers are contraindicated due to conditions such as asthma or elderly age. This patient does not have any of these contraindications, and metoprolol succinate is likely to provide relief for his angina. Ezetimibe is used as add-on therapy to statins for cholesterol management but does not have a role in the medical management of angina. The addition of long-acting nitrates and ranolazine may be considered if his angina persists despite treatment. If medical management does not control anginal symptoms, surgical treatment such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting may be considered.
