# Question ITE-2023-151

A 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, previous stroke with no residual deficits, and mild cognitive impairment presents for an annual health maintenance examination. Her documented weight 6 months ago was 79 kg (174 lb) and her current weight is 73 kg (161 lb). She is sedentary and has not changed her diet. Which one of the following is true about this patientâ€™s condition? 55 57 --- 56 58 ---

## Options

**A.** It is associated with increased mortality

**B.** It is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease

**C.** More than 50% of patients with this condition will be diagnosed with a malignancy

**D.** High-calorie dietary supplements are recommended as primary treatment

**E.** Medications do not contribute to her condition

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient has experienced a significant but unintentional weight loss of more than 5% in 6 months. Such weight loss has been associated with increased mortality in the elderly in several studies. An evaluation for etiology of the weight loss should be completed, including a history with a medication review and a physical examination, but many medical and psychiatric conditions are associated with unintentional weight loss. Unintentional weight loss is not associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. About one-third of patients with unintentional weight loss will be diagnosed with a malignancy. In the Choosing Wisely campaign, the American Geriatrics Society recommended avoidance of high-calorie dietary supplements and appetite stimulants due to the lack of evidence that they improve quality of life or offer a survival benefit. A Cochrane review of supplements in elderly patients showed a small weight gain but no overall mortality benefit. Medications, including polypharmacy, can contribute to unintentional weight loss.
