# Question ITE-2024-029

## Question
A 60 -year-old female presents to your office with a 5 -day history of pain inside her mouth. She has a 
medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, and hypothyroidism. A physical examination 
reveals several patches of white plaques in her mouth. You scrape the plaques off with a tongu e 
depressor and find inflamed, erythematous tissue under them.  
 Which one of the following medications, if included in this patient’s regimen, may have contributed 
to the development of this condition?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Atorvastatin (Lipitor)
**B)** Beclomethasone dipropionate (Qvar RediHaler)
**C)** Ipratropium bromide (Atrovent)
**D)** Isosorbide mononitrate
**E)** Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (Hyzaar)

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation

Additional risk factors include immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, malnourishment, an d use of dentures. If the lesions do not resolve with 2 –3 weeks of treatment, a biopsy should be performed to rule out precancerous or cancerous findings.
