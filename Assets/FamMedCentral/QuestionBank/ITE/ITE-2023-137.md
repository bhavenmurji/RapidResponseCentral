# Question ITE-2023-137

You have recently acquired several patients from a retiring colleague. These patients have been using topical corticosteroids over a prolonged period of time. Which one of the following patient groups is at highest risk for adverse systemic reactions to prolonged topical corticosteroid use?

## Options

**A.** Children

**B.** Young adults

**C.** Middle-aged adults

**D.** Pregnant women

**E.** Breastfeeding women

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

All patients using topical corticosteroids chronically should be monitored for adverse systemic effects, such as adrenal suppression, cataracts, decreased growth rate, and hypertension. Patients at highest risk for adverse systemic reactions to prolonged topical corticosteroid use are children and the elderly. There has been no evidence that maternal use of topical corticosteroids causes adverse pregnancy outcomes or that their use while breastfeeding is problematic.
