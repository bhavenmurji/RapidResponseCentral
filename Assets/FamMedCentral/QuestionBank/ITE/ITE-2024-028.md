# Question ITE-2024-028

## Question
A 33 -year-old gravida 1 para 1 presents to your office requesting contraceptive management. She 
recently experienced an acute stroke due to a hypertensive emergency. She is not interested in 
permanent sterilization at this time and asks your advice regarding the most appropriate contraception 
given her medical history.  
 
Which one of the following contraceptive options would be safest for this pa tient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A combined oral contraceptive
**B)** A progestin -only oral contraceptive
**C)** Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo -Provera CI)
**D)** A copper IUD (Paragard)
**E)** A levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
The 2016 U.S Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use was developed to assist providers in determining the safest forms of contraception for patients with certain health conditions and characteristics, and was updated in 2020 to address contracep tion use for women at high risk for HIV. In this case, a woman in her 30s desires reversible contraception following an acute stroke in the setting of hypertension. For a person with a history of stroke, combined hormonal contraception carries unacceptable health risks and should not be used. Use of a progestin -containing pill, injection, or subdermal implant carries risks that usually outweigh the benefits. Use of a levonorgestrel IUD carries risks, but the benefit outweighs the risk. However, only a coppe r IUD has no restriction on use and is considered the safest contraceptive option.
