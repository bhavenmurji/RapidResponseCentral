# Question ITE-2023-047

A 12-year-old transgender female accompanied by her mother comes to your office to discuss persistent gender dysphoria. The patient has been in counseling for 2 years along with her family, who is supportive of her gender identity. The patientâ€™s mother asks about puberty blockers. In discussing GnRH analogs with her, you note that the current recommendation for beginning this medication is when she is at which Tanner stage of development?

## Options

**A.** 1

**B.** 2

**C.** 3

**D.** 4

**E.** 5

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The 2022 World Professional Association for Transgender Healthcare (WPATH) standards of care recommends that in eligible adolescents, pubertal suppression may begin at Tanner stage 2. Treatment prior to the onset of puberty is not recommended. Tanner stage 1 is prepubescent and Tanner stage 2 is the initial pubescent stage. It is not necessary and may be harmful to wait for further pubertal stages before initiating puberty blockers in an eligible transgender adolescent.
