# Question ITE-2023-101

A 6-year-old female is brought to your office because of a 3-day history of productive cough, fever, and chills. She has not had any shortness of breath, wheezing, sore throat, or rash. Her past medical history is significant for mild intermittent asthma and seasonal allergies, treated with albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), fluticasone furoate (Flonase Sensimist), and cetirizine (Children’s Zyrtec Allergy). She is up to date on recommended vaccinations. Her vital signs include a temperature of 39.0°C (102.2°F), a pulse rate of 98 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 25/min, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her weight today is 20 kg (44 lb). A pulmonary examination is notable for rhonchi in the right lung fields. A chest radiograph is shown below. A rapid COVID-19 test is negative. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?

## Options

**A.** Amoxicillin

**B.** Azithromycin (Zithromax)

**C.** Doxycycline

**D.** Levofloxacin

**E.** Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The examination and chest radiograph indicate the presence of a focal bacterial pneumonia, commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Amoxicillin provides effective coverage against this infection. Local resistance of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin may be high, so it would not be the best choice. Doxycycline should not be used in children younger than 9 years. There is no evidence of atypical pneumonia (nonproductive cough, sore throat, rash, myalgia, fatigue) requiring levofloxacin. Oseltamivir is not indicated as there is no evidence of influenza or lobar pneumonia seen on chest radiography.
