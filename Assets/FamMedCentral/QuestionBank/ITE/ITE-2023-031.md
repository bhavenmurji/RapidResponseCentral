# Question ITE-2023-031

A 3-year-old male is brought to your office by his parents for evaluation of constipation that began about a year ago. They report that he cries before bowel movements, has resisted toilet training, and has unusually large stools about every 3 days, including this morning. He had normal bowel movements in infancy and his growth and development have been normal. An examination shows a healthy child with a soft, nondistended, nontender abdomen. A rectal examination reveals normal sphincter tone and minimal soft stool. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in correcting his functional constipation?

## Options

**A.** Increasing fluid intake

**B.** Increasing physical activity

**C.** Adding docusate (Colace)

**D.** Adding polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)

**E.** Adding probiotic supplements with Bifidobacterium  or Lactobacillus  species

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Polyethylene glycol is the most effective treatment for functional constipation in children. Increased fluid intake does not affect stool frequency in children. While evidence indicates that increased physical activity may improve functional constipation in adults, it does not have the same effect in children. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of docusate in pediatric patients with functional constipation. Probiotic supplements do not have enough evidence to be recommended.
