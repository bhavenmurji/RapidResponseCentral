# Question ITE-2024-106

## Question
A new vaccine is being developed. The risk for infection after vaccination is 19%. The risk for 
infection without vaccination is 47% . 
 
What is the relative risk of the subjects who received the newly manufactured vaccine?

## Answer Choices
**A)** 0.10
**B)** 0.28
**C)** 0.40
**D)** 0.66
**E)** 0.90

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
The relative risk (risk ratio) of infection for the participants who received the newly developed vaccine compared to those who did not is 0.40. The risk ratio is calculated by dividing the risk of the population under study by the risk of the population w ho is not (those who are vaccinated and those who are not, respectively): 0.19/0.47 = 0.40. In other words, vaccinated participants were 40% as likely (or 60% less likely) to contract the infection as those who were not vaccinated.
