# Question ITE-2024-018

## Question
A 35 -year-old female presents to your clinic with a 5 -day history of sinus congestion, postnasal 
drainage, and a productive cough with clear sputum. She has a history of depression, for which she 
takes sertraline (Zoloft), and no previous history of respiratory symptoms or diagnoses. She smokes 
socially. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, a heart rate of 87 beats/min, a 
respiratory rate of  16/min, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.  
 
On examination the patient has clear rhinorrhea, posterior pharynx erythema, frontal sinus tenderness 
to palpation, and clear lung fields. She has recurrent coughing episodes but does not show any sign s 
of respiratory distress.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Honey
**B)** Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)
**C)** Dextromethorphan
**D)** Hydrocodone/homatropine (Hycodan)
**E)** Prednisone

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
An acute cough is a cough of <3 weeks’ duration in people without asthma and no red - flag symptoms of dyspnea or hemoptysis, or systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or peripheral edema. Although there is significant use of prescribed and over -the- counter medications by patient s, there is limited evidence to support pharmacotherapy for the symptomatic treatment of acute cough. The majority (90% –98%) of cases of acute cough are viral upper respiratory tract symptoms that resolve within 7 –10 days. Several studies have validated the benefits of honey in patients >1 year of age for acute viral upper respiratory tract symptoms. Honey has antibacterial and antiviral properties in addition to decreasing mucus production and cough without the potential side e ffects of prescription or over -the-counter cough medications. Acute cough is typically caused by viruses and antibiotics are not indicated. Antitussives, opioids such as codeine or hydrocodone, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, inhaled β-agonists or anticholinergics, mucolytics, NSAIDs, first -generation antihistamines , decongestants, and guaifenesin have significant side -effect profiles and do not decrease illness duration or symptoms in most patients. Dextromethorphan in particular can increase the serotonin effect in patients taking SSRIs, and this patient is taking sertraline.
