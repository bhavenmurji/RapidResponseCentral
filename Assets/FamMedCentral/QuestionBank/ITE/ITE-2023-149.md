# Question ITE-2023-149

A 42-year-old female sees you for follow-up 6 weeks after starting treatment for Helicobacter pylori. She was diagnosed with the urea breath test. She completed her antibiotic regimen as prescribed and stopped her proton pump inhibitor (PPI) 2 weeks ago. She is symptom free. Which one of the following is the recommended next step?

## Options

**A.** Repeating the H. pylori urea breath test

**B.** Ordering H. pylori serology

**C.** Resuming PPI therapy

**D.** Screening for colon cancer

**E.** Screening for a peptic ulcer

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

According to current American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, whenever Helicobacter pylori is identified and treated, testing to prove eradication should be performed at least 4 weeks after completing antibiotic therapy and 2 weeks after discontinuing the proton pump inhibitor (PPI). With increasing resistance and thus declining success in treatment, many patients will be persistently infected after treatment and remain at risk for complications, including gastric malignancy. There is no role for H. pylori serology in testing for treatment success. This patient does not need further PPI therapy since she is symptom free. She is not at the age threshold to begin colon cancer screening, and without further familial risk information there is no indication to begin screening earlier. There is no evidence that she needs to be screened for a peptic ulcer.
