# Question ITE-2022-038

The most effective therapy to improve quality of life in patients with tinnitus is

## Options

**A.** a benzodiazepine

**B.** an SSRI

**C.** transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)

**D.** acupuncture

**E.** cognitive behavioral therapy

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Tinnitus is the sensation of hearing an abnormal sound, such as a ringing, buzzing, or clicking, that is perceived in the ear or head in the absence of an internal or external source. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve quality of life in patients with tinnitus. Treatments that should be avoided include benzodiazepines, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and acupuncture. An SSRI could be considered for the management of tinnitus-associated anxiety, but is not considered the most effective therapy for tinnitus.
