# Question ITE-2023-147

A 17-year-old high school football player presents the Monday after a weekend game during which he attempted a tackle and caught his left ring finger on his opponent’s uniform. On examination he has mild swelling and tenderness over the volar aspect of the affected finger, and he is unable to actively flex the distal interphalangeal joint. Plain radiographs demonstrate no bony trauma. Which one of the following management options would be most appropriate? 54 56 ---

## Options

**A.** Early referral to occupational therapy for exercises to restore active range of motion

**B.** Corticosteroid injection into the flexor tendon sheath to restore active range of motion

**C.** Two weeks of immobilization in flexion, followed by buddy taping to the middle finger

**D.** Six weeks of full-time immobilization in an extension splint

**E.** Urgent referral to an orthopedist for surgical repair of the flexor tendon

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient has sustained an avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, also known as jersey finger. The ring finger is most often involved, representing 75% of cases. The injury occurs due to forced hyperextension of an actively flexed digit, often in collision sports that involve tackling when a finger catches on an opponent’s clothing. Patients may hold the affected finger in extension relative to the other digits when the hand is at rest. The key physical examination finding is the inability to flex the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Surgical repair is the appropriate treatment for a ruptured FDP tendon, with a worsening prognosis when treatment is delayed. Although patients with jersey finger often require extended hand rehabilitation after surgery, a referral to occupational therapy prior to expedited surgical repair would delay the definitive treatment and likely result in a worse outcome. Corticosteroid injection into the flexor tendon sheath often benefits patients with stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon, also known as trigger finger. However, injecting a corticosteroid into a ruptured FDP tendon sheath would be inappropriate for management of this injury, not only by likely causing a delay in presentation to a hand surgeon, but also by potentially increasing the perioperative risk of infection and/or poor tissue healing caused by the local corticosteroid. Temporary immobilization in partial flexion followed by buddy taping is the treatment of choice for certain injuries to the proximal interphalangeal volar plate but not for FDP tendon injuries. Full-time immobilization in an extension splint for 6–8 weeks is the recommended treatment for an extensor tendon avulsion at the DIP joint, otherwise known as a mallet finger.
