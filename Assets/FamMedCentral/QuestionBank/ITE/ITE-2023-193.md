# Question ITE-2023-193

Which one of the following is the strongest risk factor for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease?

## Options

**A.** Chronic acetaminophen toxicity

**B.** Hereditary hemochromatosis

**C.** Obesity

**D.** Severe hypertriglyceridemia

**E.** Type 2 diabetes

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The strongest risk factor for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is obesity. Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome are also risk factors, but less so than obesity. NAFLD is most often asymptomatic and may be found incidentally on abdominal imaging. The presence of inflammation or hepatocellular injury with elevated liver enzymes raises suspicion for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and these patients need further evaluation for possible fibrosis, which could increase the risk for developing cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. The primary treatment of NAFLD is weight loss through diet and exercise. Secondary treatment options include bariatric surgery, thiazolidinediones, and/or GLP-1 receptor agonists. 74  Chronic acetaminophen toxicity, hereditary hemochromatosis, and severe hypertriglyceridemia can be associated with liver disease but are not considered significant risk factors for the development of NAFLD.
