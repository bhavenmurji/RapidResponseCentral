# Question ITE-2022-116

weight loss, and musculoskeletal pain for the last 6 months. He had been in good health before these symptoms started. He states that he has a “deep ache” in his lower back, hips, and shoulders that awakens him at night. Plain films of the lumbar spine ordered by an orthopedic surgeon revealed osteopenia and degenerative disease with osteophytes. A bone scan was within normal limits for his age. The only abnormalities you detect on a thorough physical examination are tenderness to percussion over the scapulae, lumbar vertebrae, and posterior pelvis, and a mildly enlarged but smooth prostate.

## Options

**A.** carcinoma of the prostate metastatic to bone

**B.** hyperparathyroidism

**C.** multiple myeloma

**D.** osteomalacia

**E.** polymyalgia rheumatica

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The combination of a high globulin-to-albumin ratio, anemia, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia in
a patient with diffuse musculoskeletal pain is highly suggestive of multiple myeloma. Serum and urine
immunoelectrophoresis would be the next test to order. Carcinoma of the prostate metastatic to bone should
be seen on a bone scan and the PSA level would be much higher. Hyperparathyroidism is part of the
differential diagnosis, but a low phosphorus level would be expected. An elevated alkaline phosphatase
level would be expected in osteomalacia. Polymyalgia rheumatica is more common in women and would
not be associated with elevated calcium and globulins and this degree of anemia.
