# Question ITE-2024-180

## Question
Which one of the following is present in polycythemia vera?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An α-1 antitrypsin deficiency
**B)** An elevated α-fetoprotein level
**C)** An elevated erythropoietin level
**D)** Antimitochondrial antibodies
**E)** A Janus kinase 2 mutation

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
The World Health Organization’s major diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera include an elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit level, abnormal bone marrow biopsy results, and the presence of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) genetic mutation, found in 98% of cases. The only minor criterion is a subnormal erythropoietin level, which helps distinguish polycythemia vera from common causes of secondary erythrocytosis such as smoking, sleep apnea, and testosterone use.
