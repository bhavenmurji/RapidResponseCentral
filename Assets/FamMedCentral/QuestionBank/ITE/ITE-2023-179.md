# Question ITE-2023-179

A 62-year-old female with a history of compensated cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis presents to establish care and has no acute issues. She has read that she may have an increased risk for liver cancer and asks if she should be screened. Which one of the following should you advise? 65 67 ---

## Options

**A.** No routine surveillance, but evaluation based on signs or symptoms

**B.** Ultrasonography every 6 months

**C.** Annual -fetoprotein testing

**D.** Annual CT

**E.** Annual MRI

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Surveillance leads to detection of HCC at earlier stages and improvements in survival rates. It is recommended that adults with cirrhosis undergo ultrasonography surveillance every 6 months with or without the addition of -fetoprotein levels. Annual CT and annual MRI are not indicated for this patient.
