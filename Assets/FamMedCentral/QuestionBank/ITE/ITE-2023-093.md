# Question ITE-2023-093

Which one of the following is most appropriate for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in otherwise healthy hospitalized infants? 35 37 ---

## Options

**A.** Supportive care including as-needed oxygen and frequent nasal hygiene

**B.** Inhaled bronchodilators

**C.** Nebulized hypertonic saline every 4 hours

**D.** Systemic corticosteroids

**E.** Chest physiotherapy three times a day

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Supportive care including as-needed oxygen and frequent nasal hygiene, in addition to hydration with intravenous fluids if indicated, are the mainstays of treatment in otherwise healthy infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Inhaled bronchodilators, nebulized hypertonic saline, systemic corticosteroids, and chest physiotherapy do not reduce the length of hospitalization and are not indicated as first-line treatment in infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis.
