# Question ITE-2024-073

## Question
A 15 -year-old patient who was recently hospitalized for anorexia nervosa sees you for a follow -up 
visit in your clinic to discuss the next steps in treatment.  Which one of the following therapies is the 
recommended next step in treatment for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Self-guided treatment
**B)** Cognitive behavioral therapy
**C)** Focal psychodynamic psychotherapy
**D)** Interpersonal psychotherapy
**E)** Family -based therapy

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Family -based therapy is recommended as first -line therapy for anorexia nervosa in adolescents and some young adults. Studies have shown that family -based therapy results in higher remission rates and weight gain than individual therapy such as self - guided treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, focal psychodynamic psychotherapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy. Family -based therapy avoids assigning blame and instead focuses on uniting the family against the disorder. Initially, parents take the lead in pro moting healthy eating behaviors as the patient slowly gains greater autonomy in feeding. The therapy improves family communication and leads to patient independence.
