# Question ITE-2024-079

## Question
A 24 -year-old male presents to your clinic to request suture repair of a 3 -cm laceration on his arm 
caused by an accidental cut with a clean knife the night before. The wound is not actively bleeding 
and there are not any signs of infection.  
 It would be acceptable to proceed with primary closure up to how many hours after the injury 
occurred?

## Answer Choices
**A)** 2
**B)** 10
**C)** 18
**D)** 24
**E)** 36

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Noninfected wounds caused by clean objects can undergo primary closure up to 18 hours after injury (evidence rating B) without a significant increase in infection rates. Noninfected head wounds can be repaired up to 24 hours after injury. These time parame ters should not be used if there are signs of contamination, the laceration length is >5 cm, the laceration is located on the lower extremities, or the patient has diabetes mellitus.
