# Question ITE-2024-198

## Question
Which one of the following conditions is most likely to impair swallowing of both solids and liquids?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Achalasia
**B)** Eosinophilic esophagitis
**C)** Esophageal cancer
**D)** Esophageal stricture
**E)** Schatzki ring

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Achalasia is a smooth muscle motility disorder that impairs swallowing of both solids and liquids. In contrast, anatomic causes of dysphagia that impede the lumen of the esophagus through mass effect or inflammation, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, esoph ageal cancer, esophageal stricture, and Schatzki rings, typically impair swallowing of solids but not liquids.
