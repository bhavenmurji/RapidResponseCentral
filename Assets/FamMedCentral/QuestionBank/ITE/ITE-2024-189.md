# Question ITE-2024-189

## Question
A 44 -year-old male presents for evaluation of left shoulder pain and stiffness that has developed 
gradually over the past few months after a fall while skiing. He describes a dull, deep, poorly 
localized ache. On examination he has impaired active and passive range of motion in all planes. 
Radiography of the shoulder is unremarkable.  
 
Which one of the following is most likely to lead to symptom resolution?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Wearing a sling on the left arm for 4 â€“6 weeks
**B)** Extracorporeal shock wave therapy
**C)** Biceps tendon sheath injection and physical therapy
**D)** Glenohumeral corticosteroid injection and physical therapy
**E)** Surgical repair

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient presents with adhesive capsulitis, manifested as the typical cardinal symptoms of pain, stiffness, and dysfunction of the affected shoulder. A combination of glenohumeral or subacromial corticosteroid injection and physical therapy is most lik ely to produce early and sustained improvement in symptoms and joint functioning. Prolonged use of a sling would worsen the condition. Referral for surgery may be indicated after a 3 -month trial of conservative treatment fails. While extracorporeal shock w ave therapy has shown benefit for frozen shoulder, its current role is as an adjunct to other primary therapies.
