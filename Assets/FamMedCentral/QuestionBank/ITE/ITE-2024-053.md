# Question ITE-2024-053

## Question
A 59 -year-old male presents to your office accompanied by his wife for evaluation of a 6 -month 
history of worsening weakness. He reports having difficulty lifting light items to the top shelf at 
work. His wife adds that he has recently been clumsier around the house.  
 
The patient’s vita l signs are normal today. On physical examination you note mild dysarthria during 
conversation, proximal weakness of the upper extremities that is more pronounced on the left, 
hyperreflexia of the biceps tendon reflex bilaterally, atrophy of the quadriceps  that is more 
pronounced on the right, and absent reflexes of the patellar tendon.  
 
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
**B)** Guillain -Barré syndrome
**C)** Hypothyroidism
**D)** Multiple sclerosis
**E)** Myasthenia gravis Item #51

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Weakness is a chief concern that is frequently encountered in medical settings, and a careful history and thorough physical examination are critical to developing an appropriate diagnosis. This patient displays features of asymmetric weakness and findings of both upper and lower motor neuron disease, which should lead to a clinical suspicion of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig disease. ALS is an insidious paralytic disorder that is currently incurable. Upper motor signs include hyperreflexia, dysarthria, clonus, and a positive Babinski sign. Lower motor signs include muscle atrophy and hyporeflexia or areflexia. Guillain -Barré syndrome is an acute neuromuscular disorder characterized by ascending muscle weakness and lower motor neuron signs that may progress to include the respiratory muscles. While hypothyroidism may lead to hyporeflexia, it is unlikely to lead to the other physical examination findings in this case. Multiple sclerosis can have a variable presentation and may display signs of unilateral weakness and upper motor neuron signs depending on the location of the lesion. Myasthenia gravis is characterize d by proximal weakness that progresses throughout the day, often includes ocular muscles, and displays lower motor neuron signs.
