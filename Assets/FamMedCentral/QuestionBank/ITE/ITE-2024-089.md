# Question ITE-2024-089

## Question
A 55-year-old female presents with lateral hip pain. You suspect greater trochanteric pain syndrome 
and prescribe anti -inflammatory medications and physical therapy.  
 
If her pain does not respond to these measures, which one of the following alternative diag noses is 
most likely?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Femoroacetabular impingement
**B)** Gluteus medius tendon tear
**C)** Ischiofemoral impingement
**D)** Labral tear
**E)** Piriformis syndrome

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
The most common cause of lateral hip pain is greater trochanteric pain syndrome (formerly referred to as greater trochanteric bursitis), which can be caused by gluteus medius tendinopathy or tearing, or iliotibial band friction. A gluteus medius tendon tea r should be considered in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome that does not respond to anti -inflammatory medications and physical therapy. MRI and/or musculoskeletal ultrasonography can be used for further diagnosis if a gluteus medius tendon tear is suspected, and surgical intervention may improve outcomes in these patients. Femoroacetabular impingement is a cause of intra -articular hip pain that usually presents with anterior pain. It is caused by bony overgrowth of the femoral head and neck or by a pincer deformity of the acetabulum and is usually bothersome with activities that require hyperflexion or a wide range of motion at the hip joint. Ischiofemoral impingement is caused by impingement of the quadratus femoris muscle and nerve between the proximal femur at the level of the lesser trochanter and ischial tuberosity, resu lting in deep buttock pain worsened by activities requiring a long stride. Labral tears are associated with anterior hip pain and may cause a popping, catching, or clicking sound with activities. Piriformis syndrome is caused by the piriformis entrapping t he sciatic nerve, and causes hip and buttock pain as well as sciatica.
