# Question ITE-2023-094

A 94-year-old male with Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and chronic low back pain is brought to your office by his daughter who cares for him in her home. The daughter is interested in any support available for her father, and she asks specific questions about palliative care and hospice. Which one of the following is needed to qualify for palliative care?

## Options

**A.** An advance directive

**B.** A do-not-resuscitate status

**C.** A life expectancy <6 months

**D.** Pain

**E.** Serious illness

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Palliative care is a team-based approach to the care of patients with serious illness. Palliative care aims to reduce symptoms and stress from a serious illness. Palliative care can function alongside treatment for serious illness. While it has traditionally been used for patients with cancer, it is available to any patient with a disease that cannot be cured. While palliative care teams can assist patients and their caregivers with advance directives and resuscitation status, there is no requirement for these to be done prior to qualifying for care. Patients are not required to have a limited life expectancy as with hospice care. The most common symptom in patients receiving palliative care is pain but it is not a criterion for qualification. 37
