# Question ITE-2022-057

discussion she discloses a long history of significant alcohol intake that has impaired her work and personal life, meeting criteria for moderate to severe alcohol use disorder. She began working with a therapist to address this issue several months ago and reports that her last drink was 26 days ago. Her health is otherwise good and laboratory studies reveal normal liver and renal function. Which one of the following medications would help reduce the risk of relapse?

## Options

**A.** Buspirone

**B.** Duloxetine (Cymbalta)

**C.** Fluoxetine (Prozac)

**D.** Naltrexone

**E.** Quetiapine (Seroquel)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is common in the United States but remains undertreated, especially with
pharmacotherapy. FDA-approved therapies include naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram.
Nonâ€“FDA-approved therapies with evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of benefit include baclofen and topiramate. AUD commonly
coexists with other psychiatric conditions and in these situations treating those comorbid conditions is
critical. For patients with coexisting depression or anxiety, buspirone, duloxetine, or fluoxetine could be
considered in addition to one of the other medications listed to address AUD. Quetiapine, which is an
antipsychotic, has no role in the treatment of AUD.
