# Question ITE-2024-023

## Question
A previously healthy 38 -year-old female presents with an acute onset of near-syncope and shortness 
of breath. An examination reveals a BMI of 34 kg/m2, a temperature of 36.9 °C (98.4 °F), an oxygen 
saturation of 92% on room air, a respiratory rate of 24/min, a heart rate of 105 beats/min, and a blood 
pressure of 118/70 mm Hg. She has some tenderness and swelling of her left lower leg.  
 Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An arterial blood gas measurement
**B)** A D-dimer level
**C)** Echocardiography
**D)** CT angiography of the chest
**E)** A ventilation -perfusion (V/Q) scan

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient’s case is highly concerning for acute pulmonary embolism. She has a high (>50%) pretest probability of a pulmonary embolus based on both the Wells criteria and Geneva score. Patients with a high pretest probability of pulmonary embolism should have CT angiography (CTA) as the initial test, while patients with a low to intermediate risk should start with a D -dimer level. An arterial blood gas measurement may be helpful but is less likely to yield the specific diagnosis. Echocardiography may be part of the evaluation of pulmonary embolus if there are signs of heart strain, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A ventilation -perfusion (V/Q) scan is less sensitive and specific than CTA and takes longer to perform, but it would be indicated i f CTA is contraindicated or not available.
