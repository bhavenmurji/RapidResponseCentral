# Question ITE-2023-145

A 56-year-old female with type 2 diabetes is hospitalized with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports that several of her diabetes medications were recently changed. Findings on physical examination and laboratory studies are consistent with acute pancreatitis. Which one of the following classes of medications is the most likely cause?

## Options

**A.** Biguanides

**B.** GLP-1 receptor agonists

**C.** Insulin

**D.** SGLT2 inhibitors

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

GLP-1 receptor agonists should be discontinued in patients suspected to have pancreatitis. Additionally, therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists should not be restarted once the pancreatitis has resolved. Although pancreatitis has been reported in clinical trials, the causality between GLP-1 receptor agonists and pancreatitis has not been established. Other medication classes such as DPP-4 inhibitors can also cause pancreatitis. Biguanides, insulin, and SGLT2 inhibitors do not cause pancreatitis (SOR C).
