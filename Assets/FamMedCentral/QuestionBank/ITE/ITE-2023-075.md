# Question ITE-2023-075

A 72-year-old male who underwent total left knee arthroplasty 3 months ago is scheduled for a routine 6-month dental visit next week. His dentist contacts you for advice regarding antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent joint infection. Which one of the following should you recommend? 28 30 ---

## Options

**A.** No antibiotic prophylaxis

**B.** Amoxicillin, 2 g orally, 1 hour before the procedure

**C.** Ceftriaxone, 1 g parenterally, 1 hour before the procedure

**D.** Delaying the dental visit for 3 months

**E.** Contacting the orthopedic surgeon who performed the arthroplasty

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

One of the most potentially devastating late complications of joint replacement surgery is infection of the prosthetic joint. Because dental procedures are known to induce transient bacteremia, the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures for patients with prosthetic joints was considered orthopedic dogma for many years. Current evidence to support this practice is limited and antibiotic use is known to increase cost, bacterial resistance, and the risk of adverse drug reactions, and in most cases the risks of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh the likelihood of benefit. Therefore, prophylaxis with antibiotics is not recommended for routine outpatient dental procedures in patients with joint replacements. Amoxicillin, 2 g orally, 1 hour prior to a dental procedure such as a cleaning would be recommended for patients with congenital heart disease and valve replacement to prevent subacute bacterial endocarditis. Prophylaxis with parenteral ceftriaxone, delaying the dental visit for 3 months, and contacting the orthopedic surgeon who performed the arthroplasty would not be appropriate in this scenario.
