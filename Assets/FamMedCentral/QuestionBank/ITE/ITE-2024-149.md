# Question ITE-2024-149

## Question
A 30 -year-old female comes to your office to establish care. She reports symptoms consistent with 
possible mild chronic malabsorption. A review of past records reveals that she was previously tested 
for celiac disease with an IgA tissue transglutaminase (t TG) level, which was negative. The review of 
systems is positive for chronic recurrent sinus infections. Examination of the head and neck, lungs, and abdomen is unremarkable.  
 
Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for a p otential cause of this 
patientâ€™s chronic abdominal and upper respiratory symptoms?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A repeat IgA tTG level
**B)** A total IgA level
**C)** Vitamin D and B 12 levels
**D)** A 24 -hour fecal fat collection study
**E)** CT of the abdomen and pelvis

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
IgA deficiency is more common in patients with celiac disease than in the general population. Patients with IgA deficiency often experience chronic upper respiratory tract infections, such as recurrent sinus infections. It is important to include a total I gA level when obtaining celiac disease panels to avoid a false -negative result. Serologic testing along with a careful history is sufficiently sensitive to rule out celiac disease, but the gold standard for diagnosis still includes duodenal biopsy. Every p atient with signs or symptoms of chronic malabsorption (diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, fat -soluble vitamin deficiencies, bloating, abdominal pain) should be tested for celiac disease. This initial laboratory testing can be performed by primary care clinicians, and specialty care should be sought if the workup fails to rule out celiac disease. Diagnostic imaging is not sensitive or specific for celiac disease. While fecal fat, vitamin D, and vitamin B 12 levels may all be part of the overall workup in this patient, they are not the most helpful tests in diagnosing celiac disease at this time.
