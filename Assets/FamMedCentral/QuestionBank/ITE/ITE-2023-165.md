# Question ITE-2023-165

A 45-year-old transgender female presents for a health maintenance visit. Her current medications include spironolactone (Aldactone), ethinyl estradiol, and escitalopram (Lexapro). Her blood pressure is within normal range. She transitioned 4 years ago and started estrogen therapy at that time. Her surgical history includes breast augmentation and vaginoplasty. There is no family history of colon, prostate, breast, or cervical cancers. Which one of the following preventive screenings should you recommend for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Breast cancer

**B.** Cervical cancer

**C.** Colon cancer

**D.** Osteoporosis

**E.** Prostate cancer

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Family physicians should provide appropriate age-based and organ inventory–based screening recommendations to all patients. Current guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend initiating colon cancer screening at age 45 in average-risk individuals. Breast cancer screening in transgender females is complicated by a lack of consensus on screening recommendations in cisgender females and limited evidence. In general, expert guidelines recommend starting breast cancer screening in transgender females at age 50 and after 5–10 years of feminizing hormone therapy. Cervical cancer screening would be a concern in transgender males, not transgender females. Osteoporosis screening is not recommended at this age for a patient of any gender unless there have been concerning fractures or other risk factors. The prostate is not removed during vaginoplasty, but screening is not recommended prior to age 50, if at all.
