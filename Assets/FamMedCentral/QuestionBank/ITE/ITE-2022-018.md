# Question ITE-2022-018

is positive for streptococcal pharyngitis. She returns to your office after completing a 10-day course of penicillin this morning. She says that although she saw some initial improvement, she now has a sore throat again, accompanied by a runny nose and cough. Her mother asks if another antibiotic would be appropriate. A physical examination reveals nonexudative pharyngitis, but a rapid antigen test for group A Streptococcus  is again positive. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment at this point?

## Options

**A.** No further antibiotic therapy

**B.** Oral azithromycin (Zithromax) for 5 days

**C.** Oral ciprofloxacin (Cipro) for 10 days

**D.** A single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin

**E.** A single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Most bacteriologic treatment failures for group A Streptococcus  (GAS) represent a GAS carrier state. This
patient had clinical improvement followed by a second illness with typical features of a viral infection. Oral
azithromycin, oral ciprofloxacin, intramuscular benzathine penicillin, and intramuscular ceftriaxone are
not appropriate for the treatment of viral infections in a patient who is a pharyngeal GAS carrier.

streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis  2012;55(10):e86-e102.
