# Question ITE-2022-110

pain. His medical history is unremarkable with no cardiac risk factors. The patient’s vital signs include a temperature of 39.0°C (102.2°F), a heart rate of 120 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 24/min, a blood pressure of 90/58 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is awake and able to follow commands. An examination reveals warm skin with a capillary refill time of 2–3 seconds. The patient has normal heart sounds with a rapid peripheral pulse and no evidence of jugular vein distention. A chest radiograph is suggestive of pneumonia. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in treatment?

## Options

**A.** Administering a 1-L bolus of half-normal saline

**B.** Administering epinephrine by auto-injector

**C.** Administering a minimum of 30 mL/kg of lactated Ringer’s solution within the first 3

**D.** Starting a dobutamine drip at 2 μg/kg/min

**E.** Starting a norepinephrine drip at 0.05 μg/kg/min

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

This patient has an acute febrile illness and meets criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS) and decompensated shock. Shock is a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment to prevent
death or other complications. The four types of shock are differentiated based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) on clinical signs. Correct
treatment hinges on accurate determination of the type of shock. This patient demonstrates high-output
shock typical of septic shock. Initial treatment of septic shock begins with fluid resuscitation using isotonic
crystalloid by an intravenous or intraosseous route. Recent guidelines recommend a minimum of 30 mL/kg
of isotonic crystalloid, with a preference for lactated Ringer’s solution over normal saline. Hypotonic
solutions, such as half-normal saline, should never be administered as a bolus. There is no indication for
epinephrine or dobutamine in this patient. Norepinephrine can be indicated for septic shock that has not
responded to fluid resuscitation.
