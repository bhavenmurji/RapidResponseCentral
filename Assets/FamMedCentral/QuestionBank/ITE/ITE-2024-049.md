# Question ITE-2024-049

## Question
A 4-month -old female is brought to your office for a well child check. She is here with her mother and 
2 older brothers, who are also your patients. The family looks forward to swimming at the local outdoor 
community pool, going to the beach, and gardening this summer.  
 
Which one of the following should you recommend to reduce this family's risk for skin cancer related 
to sun exposure?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Applying sunscreen with an SPF â‰¥15 to the infant before taking her outside
**B)** Avoiding going to the pool during the middle of the day, and encouraging them to take breaks in the shade
**C)** Going to the beach only on cloudy days when ultraviolet rays are absent
**D)** Wearing a baseball cap for sun protection when gardening

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Exposure to UV light is known to increase the risk for skin cancer. UV rays are strongest from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., so going to the pool in the early morning will reduce exposure. The FDA does not recommend the use of sunscreen in infants under 6 month s of age. Children under 6 months of age should be kept out of direct sunlight. UV rays still damage skin on cloudy days. Hats should shade the ears and the back of the neck as well as the face, so a baseball cap is not a good choice.
