# Question ITE-2023-008

A 52-year-old male presents to your office for a routine annual health maintenance examination. He has a past medical history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.6%. He is also a chronic tobacco smoker. He requests screening for testicular cancer because his close friend recently died from the disease. Other than colon cancer in his adoptive father, there is no known family history of cancer. Which one of the following is indicated for testicular cancer screening for this patient?

## Options

**A.** No screening

**B.** An -fetoprotein level

**C.** Scrotal ultrasonography now

**D.** Scrotal ultrasonography at age 55

**E.** CT of the abdomen and pelvis at age 55

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Although testicular cancer is the most common solid cancer in men ages 15â€“34, with effective treatment and an overall survival rate of 97%, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for testicular cancer in asymptomatic adolescent or adult males (D recommendation). A detailed history and physical examination should be obtained in symptomatic patients, followed by scrotal ultrasonography if there are positive findings on history and physical examination. Tumor markers and CT of the abdomen and pelvis are required for staging, treatment recommendations, and surveillance, but not for screening purposes.
