# Question ITE-2022-144

not seen a medical provider in the past 10 years. He has one sex partner, exercises regularly, and follows a Mediterranean diet. He has a 10-pack-year smoking history and quit 20 years ago. He has a family history of type 2 diabetes. Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, which one of the following screening recommendations requires shared decision-making with the patient?

## Options

**A.** Office blood pressure measurement

**B.** A depression assessment with the Patient Health Questionnaire–9

**C.** A whole-body skin examination

**D.** A fasting lipoprotein profile

**E.** Prostate-specific antigen testing

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient presents for a health maintenance examination in which evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]])-based guidelines are used
to promote health, screen for chronic disease, prevent complications of chronic disease, and recommend
age-appropriate cancer screenings. Because both screening and not screening for prostate cancer with a
prostate-specific antigen test are reasonable options, shared decision-making with the patient and
consideration of his particular situation are necessary. For a male in his fifties, the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends hypertension screening with office blood pressure
measurement, depression screening with the Patient Health Questionnaire–9, and cardiovascular disease
screening with a lipoprotein profile. A whole-body skin examination for skin cancer screening is not
recommended by the USPSTF due to insufficient evidence regarding the benefits versus the harms.
