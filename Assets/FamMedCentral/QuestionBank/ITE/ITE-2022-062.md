# Question ITE-2022-062

Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are most likely to develop extrarenal cysts in which one of the following locations?

## Options

**A.** Liver

**B.** Pancreas

**C.** Spleen

**D.** Central nervous system

**E.** Reproductive system

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary cause of kidney disease and is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. The most common extrarenal cystic complication is the formation of liver cysts, which are found in >90% of patients with ADPKD who are older than 35 years of age. Other locations for ADPKD-related cyst formation include the pancreas, spleen, and reproductive system, although these are not as common as hepatic cysts. The most severe complication of ADPKD is intracranial aneurysms, which are 2â€“4 times more prevalent in patients with ADPKD than in the general population but are not as common as liver cysts.
