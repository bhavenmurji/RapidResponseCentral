# Question ITE-2023-028

The most common electrolyte abnormality in a patient with primary hyperaldosteronism is

## Options

**A.** hypocalcemia

**B.** hypokalemia

**C.** hyponatremia

**D.** hyperkalemia

**E.** hypernatremia

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Primary hyperaldosteronism was previously thought to be rare, but it is now considered one of the more common causes of secondary hypertension. Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in patients with hyperaldosteronism. Excess aldosterone secretion independent of the renin-angiotensin system causes renal potassium wasting, although about half of patients with hyperaldosteronism have normal potassium levels. Hypocalcemia is commonly associated with inadequate levels of parathyroid hormone. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are associated with primary hypoaldosteronism. Hypernatremia is not a common finding in primary hyperaldosteronism.
