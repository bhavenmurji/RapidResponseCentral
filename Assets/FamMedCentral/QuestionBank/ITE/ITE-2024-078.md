# Question ITE-2024-078

## Question
A 73 -year-old female presents with chronic diarrhea. You suspect microscopic colitis and order 
colonoscopy.  
 
Based on the suspected diagnosis, you should expect which one of the following colonoscopy 
findings?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Granulomas
**B)** Normal mucosa
**C)** Patchy ulcerations
**D)** Pseudomembranes

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
In a patient with microscopic colitis, the most common finding on colonoscopy is normal mucosa. Because the mucosa appears normal, microscopic colitis needs to be diagnosed with biopsy. Granulomas may be found in patients with Crohn disease. Ulcerations ar e found in ulcerative colitis. Pseudomembranes are found in Clostridioides difficile infection. Granulomatous changes and pseudomembranes may also require biopsy for diagnosis.
