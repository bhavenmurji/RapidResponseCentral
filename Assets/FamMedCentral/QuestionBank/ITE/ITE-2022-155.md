# Question ITE-2022-155

receive the influenza vaccine because she developed hives many years ago after eating eggs. Which one of the following would you recommend?

## Options

**A.** Avoiding influenza vaccine

**B.** Proceeding with in-office vaccination without premedication

**C.** Diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy), 50 mg 4 hours prior to vaccination

**D.** Prednisone, 20 mg 4 hours prior to vaccination

**E.** Referral to an allergist for desensitization

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

It is uncommon for people to experience severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, after influenza
vaccination. This is true even for those with egg allergies, despite the fact that embryonic chicken eggs
are used to grow most influenza vaccine viruses. Influenza vaccine is safe to administer regularly to those
who have only had hives after exposure to eggs. If more serious allergic symptoms occur with egg
exposure, such as respiratory distress or anaphylaxis, influenza vaccine should be administered in an
inpatient or supervised outpatient setting. Premedication with diphenhydramine or prednisone is not
recommended. Referral to an allergist for desensitization would not be recommended for this patient.
