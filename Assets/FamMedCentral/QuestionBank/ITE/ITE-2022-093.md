# Question ITE-2022-093

Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for individuals starting at age

## Options

**A.** 45 with a 15-pack-year smoking history

**B.** 50 with a 20-pack-year smoking history

**C.** 55 with a 30-pack-year smoking history

**D.** 60 with a 35-pack-year smoking history

**E.** 65 with a 40-pack-year smoking history

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both women and men, after breast cancer for women
and prostate cancer for men. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, making it
important for primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) care providers to screen for this disease process. The primary risk factor for lung
cancer is tobacco smoking, which accounts for 90% of all lung cancer cases. Lung cancer has a relatively
poor prognosis, but early-stage lung cancer is more amenable to treatment and has a better prognosis.
Low-dose CT has a reasonable specificity and high sensitivity for lung cancer in patients at high risk. The
eligibility criteria were recently updated by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force due to evidence of
mortality benefit, with a recommendation for screening to begin at age 50 for patients with a 20-pack-year
smoking history who are current smokers or have quit within the past 15 years.
