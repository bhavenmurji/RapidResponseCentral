# Question ITE-2023-148

A 55-year-old male with a 10-pack-year history of smoking as a young adult sees you for follow-up after a recent hospitalization for community-acquired right lower lobe pneumonia. His symptoms resolved after standard antibiotic treatment. Which one of the following should you recommend regarding follow-up radiography?

## Options

**A.** No follow-up chest imaging

**B.** A standard chest radiograph 2 weeks after treatment

**C.** A standard chest radiograph 6 weeks after treatment

**D.** Standard chest CT 6 weeks after treatment

**E.** Low-dose chest CT 12 weeks after treatment and again in 1 year

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

For most patients with community-acquired pneumonia and resolution in 7 days, a follow-up chest radiograph is not recommended. Exceptions would include suspicion of a possible mass or lymphadenopathy. Although this patient is over 50 years of age, he does not meet the criteria for low-dose CT screening for lung cancer, which is recommended in adults ages 50–80 who have a 20-pack-year smoking history, and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. 57
