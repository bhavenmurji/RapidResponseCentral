# Question ITE-2022-117

that began at rest with associated shortness of breath. In addition, he has had a mild dry cough and rhinorrhea for a few days but no fever. He has not had any nausea, dizziness, or diaphoresis, and the chest pain does not radiate. He has no past medical history, takes no medications, consumes 4–6 alcoholic drinks per night, and does not smoke. On examination the patient has a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), a blood pressure of 150/100 mm Hg, a heart rate of 118 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient appears well, and an HEENT examination reveals no jugular vein distention. A cardiovascular examination is significant for tachycardia without murmur. There is no chest wall tenderness to palpation. The lungs reveal decreased breath sounds on the right compared to the left, and there are no crackles or wheezes. A chest radiograph and an EKG are shown below. Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of his chest pain?

## Options

**A.** Aspiration pneumonia

**B.** Community-acquired pneumonia

**C.** Non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction

**D.** Pneumothorax

**E.** Pulmonary embolus

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This chest radiograph is consistent with a large right pneumothorax and complete lung collapse. In
addition, there is a leftward mediastinal shift that raises the concern for a tension pneumothorax. The chest
radiograph is not consistent with aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. While a
non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolus could have a similar presentation, this
abnormal chest radiograph points to pneumothorax as the most likely diagnosis.
