# Question ITE-2022-046

Which one of the following is necessary to make the diagnosis of a functional gastrointestinal disorder?

## Options

**A.** Symptom-based clinical criteria

**B.** Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori  infection

**C.** Celiac serology

**D.** Gastric emptying studies

**E.** Esophagogastroduodenoscopy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

In the absence of red-flag symptoms such as nocturnal defecation, weight loss, or gastrointestinal bleeding, functional gastrointestinal disorders can be diagnosed using symptom-based clinical criteria. Symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain related to defecation, pain related to a change in the frequency of defecation, abdominal bloating and distension, and loose and watery or lumpy and hard stools are used to diagnose functional bowel disorders. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori , celiac serology, gastric emptying studies, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are not required in order to make a diagnosis.
