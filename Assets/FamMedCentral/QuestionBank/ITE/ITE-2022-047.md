# Question ITE-2022-047

previous pregnancies she became hypertensive and had bilateral leg edema and proteinuria. These conditions resolved after delivery. Her only current medication is a prenatal vitamin. In order to prevent this condition, which one of the following should be started today?

## Options

**A.** No new medications

**B.** Aspirin

**C.** Fish oil

**D.** Magnesium

**E.** Vitamin C

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Preeclampsia is diagnosed when the blood pressure is ï‚³140/90 mm Hg on two separate occasions after 20
weeks gestation, accompanied by proteinuria (>300 mg protein in a 24-hour urine collection or 2+
protein on a dipstick). If there is no protein in the urine, new-onset hypertension and the presence of any
of the following would meet the criteria for preeclampsia: thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired
liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual symptoms. This patient had preeclampsia during
her previous pregnancies, which puts her at high risk for preeclampsia during her current pregnancy.
Aspirin, 81 mg daily, is recommended for high-risk pregnant patients to prevent preeclampsia. Prophylaxis
should begin after 12 weeks gestation and continue until delivery. Fish oil, magnesium, and vitamin C are
not beneficial in the prevention of preeclampsia.
