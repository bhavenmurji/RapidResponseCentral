# Question ITE-2024-012

## Question
An 80 -year-old female presents for follow -up of urge urinary incontinence after having completed a 
course of pelvic floor physical therapy with minimal improvement. Her medical history includes 
hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin (Lipitor) and chronic insomnia treated with doxepin 
(Silenor). A physical examination, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis are all normal. She requests a trial of a medication for her overactive bladder.  
 Which one of the following would be most likely to improve her symptoms, while minimizing the 
risk for adverse side effects?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Conjugated estrogens (Premarin)
**B)** Duloxetine (Cymbalta)
**C)** Mirabegron (Myrbetriq)
**D)** Oxybutynin
**E)** Tolterodine (Detrol)

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Pharmacologic options for the treatment of urge incontinence, or overactive bladder (OAB), include antimuscarinic medications such as tolterodine and oxybutynin, and β- adrenergic agonists such as mirabegron and vibegron. Antimuscarinic medications should b e used with caution in older patients due to high risk for anticholinergic side effects such as tachycardia, confusion, constipation, dry mouth, and blurry vision. Selective antimuscarinics such as darifenacin and solifenacin are preferred to their nonsele ctive counterparts such as oxybutynin and tolterodine due to a lower risk for cognitive adverse effects. The risk for anticholinergic side effects also increases for patients who are already taking medications with anticholinergic potential such as doxepin , a tricyclic antidepressant that is also used in the treatment of insomnia. β- Agonist –related side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, dizziness, and headache; mirabegron but not vibegron has also been associated with elevated blood pressure. In g eneral, however, β-agonists introduce a lower risk for adverse effects than antimuscarinic medications and are preferred for older patients who are at increased risk for anticholinergic side effects. Intravaginal estrogen may improve OAB symptoms, but it is not FDA approved for this indication. Oral estrogen worsens incontinence and introduces a risk for adverse effects related to systemic hormone therapy. Duloxetine, an SNRI, has low -level evidence of benefit for stress incontinence but not for urge incontinence.
