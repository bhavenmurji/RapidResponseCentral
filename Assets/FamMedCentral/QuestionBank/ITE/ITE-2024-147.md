# Question ITE-2024-147

## Question
A 46 -year-old female with a BMI of 36 kg/m2 and a history of bilateral tubal ligation presents with 
intermenstrual bleeding. An endometrial biopsy reveals endometrial hyperplasia with atypia.  
 
Which one of the following should you recommend at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Oral progesterone
**B)** Combined oral contraceptives
**C)** A levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)
**D)** Uterine MRI
**E)** Hysterectomy

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patientâ€™s age and elevated BMI put her at risk for endometrial cancer. Appropriate evaluation includes an endometrial biopsy. Patients who have endometrial hyperplasia with atypia should be referred for hysterectomy, as it is the treatment of choice. Oral progesterone may be offered to a patient who desires a future pregnancy. Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia may be treated with a levonorgestrel IUD or oral progesterone. Uterine MRI would not offer any additional information for diagnosis and would not change the need for hysterectomy.
