# Question ITE-2024-107

## Question
A 39-year-old female presents to discuss long -standing dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. Her 
symptoms have been present for years and have not significantly changed. She is up to date on 
cervical cancer screening and does not have any risk factors for sexually t ransmitted infections. She 
has given birth once and does not wish to conceive again. She has a medical history of hypertension 
that is well controlled on amlodipine (Norvasc). On bimanual examination you note a slightly 
enlarged uterus with some mild tende rness and no cervical motion tenderness. You suspect 
adenomyosis.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Transvaginal ultrasonography
**B)** CT of the pelvis
**C)** MRI of the pelvis
**D)** Hysteroscopy
**E)** Endometrial biopsy

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
The preferred initial diagnostic test for patients with suspected adenomyosis is a transvaginal ultrasound. CT scans are not helpful in the diagnosis. While there is higher specificity with MRI of the pelvis, its cost and availability make it a less desira ble first choice. Hysteroscopy may be helpful if the diagnosis is in question due to an inconclusive ultrasound. Endometrial biopsy does not aid in the diagnosis of adenomyosis, but it may be indicated to evaluate for hyperplasia or malignancy in a patient who is older or has worsening symptoms.
