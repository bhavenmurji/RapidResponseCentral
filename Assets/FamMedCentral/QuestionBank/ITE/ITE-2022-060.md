# Question ITE-2022-060

Which one of the following is the most common cause of chronic cough in an adult?

## Options

**A.** Asthma

**B.** Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease

**C.** Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis

**D.** Protracted bacterial bronchitis

**E.** Upper airway cough syndrome

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Chronic cough in adults is a common presenting symptom for primary care visits. The four most common
causes of chronic cough in adults include upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, nonasthmatic
eosinophilic bronchitis, and reflux-related disorders. UACS, previously referred to as postnasal drip
syndrome, is the most common cause of chronic cough in adults. This syndrome can have multiple
etiologies, including chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and nonallergic rhinitis. The diagnosis may
be suggested by symptoms of rhinorrhea such as nasal stuffiness, sneezing, and postnasal drainage, but
the absence of these symptoms does not rule out the diagnosis. The most common causes of chronic cough
in children 6â€“14 years of age are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and UACS.
