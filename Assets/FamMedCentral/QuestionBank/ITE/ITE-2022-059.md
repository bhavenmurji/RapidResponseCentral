# Question ITE-2022-059

to your area. He has been stable on clozapine (Clozaril) for the past 15 years and asks you to refill his prescription. He has been told the earliest available appointment with a local psychiatric provider is in 3 months. Under the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, which one of the following is required to prescribe clozapine to this patient?

## Options

**A.** A signed patient consent form

**B.** Serum clozapine levels

**C.** Creatinine levels

**D.** Neutrophil counts

**E.** Specialty training in psychiatry

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Clozapine is a highly effective antipsychotic medication, but its use is limited due to its association with
severe drug-induced neutropenia, also referred to as agranulocytosis. Patients must be enrolled in the
national Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to receive treatment, and all
prescribers and pharmacies must be certified by this program in order to dispense clozapine. The patientâ€™s
absolute neutrophil count must be submitted at least every 30 days, or more frequently as determined by
stability in treatment. A signed patient consent form should be obtained but is not a part of the Clozapine
REMS monitoring system. Monitoring serum clozapine levels and creatinine levels may be appropriate but
is not part of the Clozapine REMS program. Family physicians can prescribe clozapine if registered and
certified in the Clozapine REMS program, which includes passing a brief knowledge assessment, but
specialty training in psychiatry is not required.
