# Question ITE-2022-114

reduced ejection fraction has developed stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Which one of the following would be the best option for treatment of his diabetes?

## Options

**A.** Glimepiride (Amaryl)

**B.** Insulin glargine (Lantus)

**C.** Metformin

**D.** Pioglitazone (Actos)

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Patients with end-stage renal disease and diabetes mellitus need careful monitoring of glucose because
insulin requirements are difficult to predict and there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia in this setting.
The optimal hemoglobin A1c has not been established but maintaining a value between 6% and 9% does
decrease mortality. With close monitoring, insulin is preferred for most individuals. Sulfonylureas such
as glimepiride and glyburide are associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia and should be avoided in
these patients. Metformin should be avoided in those with a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73
m2. Pioglitazone should also be avoided in chronic kidney disease due to the risk of fluid retention and
precipitating heart failure.
