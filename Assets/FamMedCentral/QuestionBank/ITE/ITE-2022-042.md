# Question ITE-2022-042

afternoon. Earlier in the day she misjudged the location of a bench at a neighbor’s house and sat down hard on the porch floor. She felt immediate pain in her back. She went home and took naproxen, 440 mg, and sustained-release acetaminophen, 1300 mg, 3 hours ago. She still describes her pain as unbearable, rating it as 10 on a scale of 10. You agree to meet her in the emergency department, where you confirm an acute T12 vertebral compression fracture. Of the following, the most appropriate treatment option for this patient’s acute pain is a short course of

## Options

**A.** prescription-strength NSAIDs

**B.** methadone

**C.** transdermal fentanyl

**D.** immediate-release oxycodone (Roxicodone)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The most appropriate treatment for this patient’s acute pain following a T12 vertebral compression fracture
is round-the-clock class II narcotics. Subcutaneous calcitonin can also be useful for relieving pain from
vertebral fractures. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are usually insufficient during the acute phase of a
vertebral compression fracture, and this patient has already tried these. Methadone or transdermal fentanyl
can be used, but plasma levels of methadone may take 5–7 days to stabilize and fentanyl takes 24–48 hours
to take effect.
