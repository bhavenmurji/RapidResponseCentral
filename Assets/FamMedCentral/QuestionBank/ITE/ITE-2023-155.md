# Question ITE-2023-155

A 5-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her parents after her temperature increases to 104°F. On examination she has noticeable inspiratory stridor. She is restless and drooling, and her voice is muffled. In spite of the nurse’s repeated efforts to get the child to lie back, the patient continues to sit forward in a sniffing position. Her parents indicate that they have declined vaccinations for the patient since leaving the hospital after delivery. Which one of the following is the most important next step in management?

## Options

**A.** Supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula

**B.** Intravenous fluids

**C.** Arterial blood gas measurement

**D.** A CBC

**E.** Direct visualization of the epiglottis in the operating room

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The most likely diagnosis is epiglottitis. Inflammatory edema of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues is potentially life-threatening, as this edema can lead to complete airway obstruction. The epiglottis must be visualized in the operating room in case of life-threatening spasms that can lead to airway obstruction. The surgeon must be prepared to perform tracheostomy if airway obstruction develops. Supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, and laboratory studies are reasonable supportive and diagnostic options. However, immediate intervention in the operating room is the most important next step to prevent airway obstruction.
