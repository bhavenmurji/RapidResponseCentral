# Question ITE-2023-063

A 55-year-old male presents with intermittent epigastric pain, early satiety, and bloating. His symptoms have been present for years with minimal change. You suspect a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia. Which one of the following additional findings would constitute an alarm symptom and warrant further workup? 23 25 ---

## Options

**A.** Epigastric tenderness

**B.** Increased abdominal pain when the abdominal wall muscles are tensed

**C.** Lymphadenopathy

**D.** Nausea

**E.** Weight gain

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

In patients with epigastric pain, alarm symptoms include age ï‚³60, persistent vomiting, unintended weight loss, dysphagia or odynophagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, a palpable mass, lymphadenopathy, night waking, symptoms that have a sudden/recent onset or are progressive in character, a family history of gastrointestinal cancer, and a poor response to empiric therapy. Epigastric tenderness is common in patients with functional dyspepsia and is not concerning unless accompanied by other alarm findings. Abdominal pain that increases when the abdominal wall muscles are tensed is called the Carnett sign. It is indicative of abdominal wall pain (musculoskeletal) and is not an alarm symptom for patients with dyspepsia. Chronic nausea is common and, unless accompanied by chronic vomiting, it is not an alarm symptom. Weight loss, not weight gain, is an alarm symptom.
