# Question ITE-2022-179

(Cologuard). The result is negative and you are composing a message to send to his online patient portal to discuss the results. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate screening strategy for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) now

**B.** FIT in 1 year

**C.** Colonoscopy now

**D.** Repeat multitarget stool DNA testing in 3 years

**E.** Repeat multitarget stool DNA testing in 5 years

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The recommended interval for colon cancer screening with multitarget stool DNA testing is 3 years at
minimum, with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommending an interval of 1â€“3 years. If the
screening is positive, proceeding with a colonoscopy is recommended. Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)
has an annual screening interval if the test is negative, and colonoscopy is recommended if the FIT is
positive. Colonoscopy for patients without risk factors should be performed every 10 years, or sooner if
indicated by pathology results or risk factors.
