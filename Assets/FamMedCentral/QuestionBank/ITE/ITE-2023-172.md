# Question ITE-2023-172

A 78-year-old male presents to your office for a health maintenance visit at the request of his spouse. He does not have any current symptoms or concerns. He states that he has not seen a physician since he was a teenager. The patient reports breaking his arm as a child but has no other known medical conditions. He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking cigarettes but has not smoked for 10 years. He has one glass of wine with dinner 3–4 times a month and does not use illicit substances. His sexual history consists of sex with only his wife. His family history includes a mother who died of a stroke and a father who died of pancreatic cancer. He walks 2 miles five times a week. His vital signs and a physical examination are normal. Which one of the following screenings is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Hepatitis B testing

**B.** Prostate-specific antigen testing

**C.** Abdominal aortic aneurysm ultrasonography

**D.** A DEXA scan

**E.** Low-dose CT of the chest

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT of the chest for men and women ages 50–80 with a 20-pack-year smoking history or more, or patients who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the past 15 years (B recommendation). This patient is 78 years old with a 30-pack-year history and he quit smoking only 10 years ago. 66  Patients at increased risk for hepatitis B virus infection should be tested (B recommendation). This patient does not have a history that is high risk for hepatitis B infection, such as needle-sharing, injecting illicit substances, having sex with other men, and HIV infection, so he does not need to be tested at this time. Shared clinical decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men ages 55–69 years should be considered. This patient’s age makes PSA testing inappropriate (D recommendation). According to the clinical evidence, one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with ultrasonography demonstrates moderate benefit for males between the ages of 65–75 who have ever smoked or have smoked at least 100 cigarettes (B recommendation). Smoking history is the strongest predictor for AAA (B recommendation). This patient does have a smoking history, but his age is outside the recommended window for AAA screening. According to the USPSTF, there is insufficient evidence to screen men for osteoporosis (I recommendation), so a DEXA scan would not be appropriate.
