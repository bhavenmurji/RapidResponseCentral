# Question ITE-2023-170

A 60-year-old male with recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer presents to the emergency department with generalized weakness and altered mental status. He has a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F) and a blood pressure of 134/78 mm Hg. His pulse rate is 100 beats/min and regular. A physical examination reveals confusion and dry oral mucosa. An EKG reveals sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and a short ST segment. Aside from his known lung mass, imaging studies including head CT and a chest radiograph are normal. Laboratory studies, including a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate level, are normal except for a serum calcium level of 14.0 mg/dL (N 8.0–10.0) and a creatinine level of

## Options



## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient presents with malignant hypercalcemia, which in this case is most likely due to parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) production from his squamous cell lung cancer. The first step in management is to correct the volume depletion that is associated with the hypercalcemia, which commonly occurs due to the combined effects of anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This often leads to extreme dehydration followed by a decreased glomerular filtration rate, which reduces the kidneys’ ability to excrete calcium, thereby compounding the electrolyte disturbance. An initial 2-liter intravenous fluid bolus in this case would be an appropriate first step. Once the volume status has been addressed and renal function is stabilized, additional treatment options may include loop diuretics such as furosemide, corticosteroids such as prednisone or methylprednisolone, and/or bisphosphonates such as pamidronate, depending on the clinical circumstances. In patients with severe chronic kidney disease or acute, life-threatening hypercalcemia, calcium may be removed via dialysis, although preparing for imminent dialysis would not be appropriate for this patient.
