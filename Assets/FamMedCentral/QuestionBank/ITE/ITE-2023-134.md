# Question ITE-2023-134

A 39-year-old male presents during influenza season with symptoms of nasal congestion and sore throat associated with a cough. He is most bothered by his severe laryngitis, and is concerned about a planned conference where he will be speaking next week. He would like the symptoms to resolve quickly, and is being proactive so it does not lead to pneumonia. His symptoms started 5 days ago and have been constant. He had a fever of 100°F for the first 3 days. On examination he has a fever, appears tired and mildly ill, and has a red pharynx and a very hoarse voice. The remainder of the examination is normal. Which one of the following should you recommend for management of this patient’s condition?

## Options

**A.** Reassurance and vocal rest

**B.** Inhaled fluticasone (Flovent)

**C.** Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

**D.** Levofloxacin

**E.** Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Laryngitis and an accompanying hoarse voice are viral symptoms, and antibiotics will not help. Fluticasone is effective for the treatment of asthma, but has no value in acute laryngitis. Oseltamivir can be used during influenza season for empiric treatment for influenza-like illness, but is only effective if started within the first 3 days of illness.
