# Question ITE-2022-188

Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?

## Options

**A.** A normal pattern

**B.** A mixed pattern

**C.** A restrictive pattern

**D.** A reversible obstructive pattern

**E.** An irreversible obstructive pattern

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the total amount of air that can be expelled from full lungs. A decreased
FVC on spirometry indicates a restrictive pattern. FEV1 is the volume of air (in liters) that is exhaled in
the first second during forced exhalation after maximal inspiration. A normal FEV1/FVC ratio and normal
FVC would indicate a normal pattern. A decreased FEV1/FVC ratio with a decreased FVC is consistent
with a mixed pattern. A reduced FEV1/FVC ratio indicates an obstructive pattern. A bronchodilator is then
utilized to determine whether the obstructive pattern is reversible or irreversible.
