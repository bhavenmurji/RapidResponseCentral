# Question ITE-2024-181

## Question
A 72 -year-old male presents to your office 3 months after hospitalization for an ischemic stroke. He 
has a history of diabetes mellitus that is well controlled on basal insulin. He has impaired mobility 
and balance, as well as left upper and lower extremity spasticity. He has fallen twice in the last week. His blood pressure is well controlled and recent laboratory studies are notable for an LDL -choles
terol 
level of 64 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A 1c of 6.9%. There is no evidence of cognitive impairment. His 
Patient Health Questionnaire –9 (PHQ- 9) score is 3.  
 Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in optimizing his post -stroke 
care?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Repeating neuroimaging
**B)** Increasing the basal insulin dosage
**C)** Initiating lorazepam (Ativan), 1 –2 mg at bedtime
**D)** Initiating sertraline (Zoloft), 50 mg daily
**E)** Referral to a physical therapist

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient has common post -stroke complications and will benefit from physical therapy to address his mobility and spasticity, and to prevent falls. Repeat neuroimaging would only be indicated with a change in neurologic examination, including new focal neurologic deficits. His diabetes mellitus is adequately controlled and further increasing his insulin puts him at increased risk of hypoglycemia. Lorazepam is not first -line therapy for spasticity and is also associated with increased fall risk. Depressio n is common post stroke, but this patient is not reporting symptoms of low mood and has a normal Patient Health Questionnaire –9 score.
