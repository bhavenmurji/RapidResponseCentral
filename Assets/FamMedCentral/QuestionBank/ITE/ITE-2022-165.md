# Question ITE-2022-165

hepatitis A is positive. Her 12-year-old twin boys, who are in good health, have not been vaccinated against hepatitis A or B and are currently asymptomatic. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for these children?

## Options

**A.** No prophylaxis

**B.** Hepatitis A vaccine only

**C.** Immune globulin only

**D.** Hepatitis A vaccine and immune globulin

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

All unvaccinated household contacts and sexual contacts should receive postexposure prophylaxis following
significant exposure to hepatitis A within the previous 2 weeks. Healthy individuals 12 months to 40 years
of age should receive the hepatitis A vaccine as prophylaxis. Infants younger than 12 months of age should
receive immune globulin as postexposure prophylaxis. Individuals >40 years of age, as well as
immunocompromised patients, should receive both hepatitis A vaccine and immune globulin.
