# Question ITE-2024-074

## Question
A 67 -year-old female presents for an annual health maintenance examination. She has a history of 
GERD, asthma, and hypothyroidism. Her last colonoscopy revealed tubular adenomas. She has 
smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day since age 20. She does not have any current medical concerns. 
 
Which one of the following would be most appropriate for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Urinalysis screening for bladder cancer
**B)** Stool DNA testing (Cologuard) for colon cancer
**C)** Cytology and HPV co -testing for cervical cancer
**D)** Annual EKG screening for coronary artery disease
**E)** Annual low -dose CT screening for lung cancer

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low -dose CT for patients between the ages of 50 and 80 who have more than a 20-pack-year smoking history and either currently smoke or quit smoking within the past 15 years. This patient has a 47 -pack-year smoking history, so screening is appropriate. Neither screening urinalysis nor screening EKG is recommended in this asymptomatic patient. This patient has a history of tubular adenomas so additional colon cancer scree ning should be with a colonoscopy, not stool DNA testing. Cervical cancer screening occurs until age 65.
