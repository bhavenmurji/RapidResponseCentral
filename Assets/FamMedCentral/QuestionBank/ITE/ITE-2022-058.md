# Question ITE-2022-058

she is newly menopausal and asks you about osteoporosis screening. Her past medical history includes morbid obesity, and her family history includes type 2 diabetes in her mother and hypertension in her father. The patient is a nonsmoker and rarely consumes alcohol. Her only medication is loratadine (Claritin), 10 mg daily. Which one of the following would you recommend regarding osteoporosis screening for this patient?

## Options

**A.** No screening now or in the future, and calcium supplementation only

**B.** No screening now or in the future, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation

**C.** Radiography of her hip and lumbar spine now

**D.** A DEXA scan now

**E.** A DEXA scan at age 65

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

For women with no risk factors, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends
screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years and older with bone measurement testing such as DEXA to
prevent osteoporotic fractures (grade B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends screening for
osteoporosis with DEXA in postmenopausal women younger than age 65 who are at increased risk of
osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool (B recommendation). Factors
associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, low
body weight, and a parental history of hip fracture. This patient is not at increased risk for osteoporosis,
so a DEXA scan at age 65 would be most appropriate. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation to prevent
osteoporosis are no longer routinely recommended. Plain radiography would not be recommended as
screening for osteoporosis.
