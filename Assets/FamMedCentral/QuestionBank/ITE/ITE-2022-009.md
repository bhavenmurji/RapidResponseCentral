# Question ITE-2022-009

Which one of the following statements regarding hormone therapy for transgender patients is true?

## Options

**A.** Hormone therapy to facilitate development of secondary sex characteristics is generally reversible

**B.** Patients who receive hormone therapy generally report improved quality of life, higher self-esteem, and decreased anxiety

**C.** Masculinizing hormone therapy is associated with reduced muscle mass and fat redistribution

**D.** Patients receiving feminizing hormone therapy are at increased risk for erythrocytosis

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Hormone therapy is not required for all transgender patients, but those who receive treatment generally report improved quality of life, higher self-esteem, and decreased anxiety. Feminizing and masculinizing hormone therapies, including the use of estrogen and/or androgen therapies such as testosterone, are partially irreversible. Thus, it is important to make a reasonable, educated decision and use informed consent prior to treatment. Patients who receive masculinizing therapy are at increased risk for erythrocytosis and those who receive feminizing hormone therapy often experience reduced muscle mass and fat redistribution.
