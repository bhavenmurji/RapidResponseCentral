# Question ITE-2024-084

## Question
A 76 -year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, remote partial ileocolectomy, 
and a Schatzki ring treated with dilation presents for follow -up. The review of symptoms is negative, 
but his spouse has noted some new memory impairment. T he patient consumes a healthy vegetarian 
diet that includes dairy. Recent laboratory studies are significant for a vitamin B 12 deficiency. His 
current medications include:  
Atorvastatin (Lipitor)  
Insulin glargine (Lantus)  
Levothyroxine (Synthroid)  
Liraglutide (Victoza)  
Which one of the following factors in this patient would be the most likely cause of a vitamin B 12 
deficiency?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Diet
**B)** Diabetic therapy
**C)** Statin therapy
**D)** Esophageal condition
**E)** Surgical history

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Patients who have undergone removal of the distal ileum are at high risk for vitamin B 12 malabsorption. Metformin can increase the risk for low vitamin B 12, but this patient's diabetic therapy consists of a GLP -1 receptor agonist and insulin. A strict vegan diet, but not vegetarian, is a risk factor for vitamin B 12 deficiency. Statins and esophageal strictures are not known to affect vitamin B 12 absorption.
