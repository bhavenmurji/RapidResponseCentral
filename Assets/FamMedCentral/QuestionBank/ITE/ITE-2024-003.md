# Question ITE-2024-003

## Question
A 30 -year-old female with obesity and tobacco use disorder presents for evaluation of a persistent 
painful lump in her axilla. After an appropriate evaluation you diagnose mild hidradenitis 
suppurativa.  
 
In addition to weight loss and smoking cessation counseling, which one of the following treatment 
options would be most appropriate?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Topical clindamycin gel (Cleocin T)
**B)** Topical diclofenac gel
**C)** Topical triamcinolone cream
**D)** Oral azithromycin (Zithromax)
**E)** Oral meloxicam

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
For patients with mild hidradenitis suppurativa, topical clindamycin is recommended as first-line treatment and often works well as monotherapy (SOR B). Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa who have overweight and smoke should be advised that weight loss and smoking cessation have been shown to decrease severity of disease and improve treatment response (SOR A). For patients with moderate disease, oral tetracyclines in addition to topical clindamycin are recommended as first -line therapy. Although intrale sional triamcinolone may be considered for procedural management of mild hidradenitis suppurativa, topical triamcinolone is not recommended. Other oral antibiotics that have shown benefit include clindamycin and rifampin, although azithromycin is not a rec ommended treatment option. While NSAIDs such as topical diclofenac and oral meloxicam may help to alleviate discomfort associated with active lesions, they are not part of the routine management of hidradenitis suppurativa.
