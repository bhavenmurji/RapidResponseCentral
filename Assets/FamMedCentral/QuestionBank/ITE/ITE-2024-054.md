# Question ITE-2024-054

## Question
A 49 -year-old female presents to your office with severe left ear pain. The patient describes the pain 
as sharp and deep inside her ear and reports that it has been occurring occasionally for several years. 
The pain has become more constant over the last 2 months, and she currently rates it as 8 out of 10 on 
a pain scale. She has not previously sought an evaluation.  
 On physical examination you find a normal ear canal and tympanic membrane. The patient is only 
able to  open her mouth 2 finger widths, has clicking over the left temporomandibular joint with 
opening, and has pain with palpation of the submandibular musculature.  
 
Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this disorder ?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Reassurance that her ear is normal, and follow -up in 4 weeks if symptoms have not improved
**B)** A trial of naproxen and cyclobenzaprine
**C)** Noncontrast CT of the facial bones
**D)** Referral to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation
**E)** Referral to a maxillofacial surgeon for consideration of jaw realignment surgery

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
There is no need for imaging or further workup to determine the cause of pain in this patient with uncomplicated temporomandibular joint dysfunction with muscle spasms. The initial treatment is naproxen for inflammation and pain, as well as cyclobenzaprine for muscle spasms. Scheduling a follow -up visit without treatment is not appropriate in a patient with a clear diagnosis and available medications that can safely provide relief. A referral to either an otolaryngologist or a maxillofacial surgeon should b e deferred until a trial of medication is completed.
