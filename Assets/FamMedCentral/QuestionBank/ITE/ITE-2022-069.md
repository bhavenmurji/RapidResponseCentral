# Question ITE-2022-069

Her medical history also includes type 2 diabetes and worsening obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Her BMI is 52 kg/m2. Her heart rate is 62 beats/min and regular. Her blood pressure in the clinic today is 160/96 mm Hg, and she reports similar average readings at home. She is asymptomatic and says she has been following lifestyle modifications including a low-salt diet. She also reports that she has been adherent with her current antihypertensive regimen, which includes the following: Amlodipine (Norvasc), 10 mg daily Carvedilol (Coreg), 25 mg twice daily Chlorthalidone, 25 mg daily Losartan (Cozaar), 100 mg daily Which one of the following antihypertensive medication changes would benefit both her blood pressure and her OSA?

## Options

**A.** Switching chlorthalidone to hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily

**B.** Switching carvedilol to an equivalent dosage of metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor)

**C.** Switching losartan to an equivalent dosage of an ACE inhibitor

**D.** Increasing the current dosage of losartan to 100 mg twice daily

**E.** Adding a low dosage of spironolactone (Aldactone) to her current regimen

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Secondary forms of hypertension are common in patients with resistant hypertension, and sleep-disordered
breathing is an important cause of resistant hypertension. Multiple studies have shown that excess
aldosterone plays a key role in the association between the two. As rates of obesity and obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) have increased, the prevalence of resistant hypertension has also increased. It is estimated
that almost 17%â€“22% of patients with resistant hypertension may have undiagnosed primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]])
hyperaldosteronism. The increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptors in patients with a high BMI
contributes to hyperaldosteronism, and blockage of these receptors with medications such as spironolactone
has been shown to provide benefit in reducing the severity of OSA as well as hypertension in these
patients.
