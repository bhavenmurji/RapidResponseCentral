# Question ITE-2023-159

A 38-year-old female with a past medical history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seeks treatment for recurring nightmares, which she has been experiencing for over 2 years following a near-drowning experience. During the daytime, she has unwanted intrusive thoughts and flash images of her drowning incident, and she avoids going near swimming pools. Her nightmares are increasingly distressing and she loses several hours of sleep nightly despite adequate behavioral therapy. Which one of the following is the best initial pharmacotherapy for PTSD-associated nightmares?

## Options

**A.** Clonazepam (Klonopin)

**B.** Gabapentin (Neurontin)

**C.** Prazosin (Minipress)

**D.** Sertraline (Zoloft)

**E.** Venlafaxine (Effexor XR)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition associated with previous exposure to a traumatic event (or events). There are four symptom categories: intrusive/re-experiencing (e.g., flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance/numbing, negative change in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal (e.g., anger outbursts, hypervigilance). Prazosin, an 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, is efficient and remains the first choice for pharmacologic therapy of PTSD-associated nightmares. The data is insufficient to support the use of clonazepam for treating nightmares associated with PTSD. Gabapentin and sertraline may be used as adjunctive therapy with antipsychotic and anxiolytic agents in treating PTSD-associated nightmares. Venlafaxine may improve behavioral symptoms, but it is ineffective for treating PTSD-associated nightmares.
