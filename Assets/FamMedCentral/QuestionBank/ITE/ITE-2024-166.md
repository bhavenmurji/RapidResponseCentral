# Question ITE-2024-166

## Question
Bruising in which one of the following locations would most likely suggest a diagnosis of child 
abuse?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Forehead
**B)** Neck
**C)** Elbows
**D)** Knees
**E)** Shins

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Bruises on the torso, ears, or neck in children ≤4 years of age are predictive of child abuse. “TEN 4” is a useful mnemonic for identifying child abuse: torso (T), ear (E), neck (N), and 4 (children ≤4 years of age and any infant <4 months of age). Bruisin g is the most common injury of physical abuse and may be the only external indicator of an internal injury. Bruises vary by age, location, and pattern. Any bruises identified in a nonambulatory infant require careful medical evaluation for possible abuse. Bruising related to normal activity typically increases with age. The majority of preschool - and school -aged children have accidental bruises. The most common sites of bruising in nonabused, ambulatory children are the knees and shins, with the majority located over bony prominences, including the forehead.
