bowel syndrome (IBS -D). She has had some improvement in the consistency of her stools and in the

**D)** . She has had some improvement in the consistency of her stools and in the frequency and urgency of her bowel movements with the addition of a psyllium supplement, but she continues to have periodic s
**E)** Wheat bran

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Peppermint oil has evidence of benefit in alleviating symptoms related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and is recommended by the American College of Gastroenterologists, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the British Society of Gastroenterology in their clinical practice guidelines. Peppermint oil is classified as an antispasmodic, and it is thought to have a relaxant effect on smooth muscle due to the blockade of calcium channels. Enteric -coated formulations are recommended to a void esopha geal reflux that may occur due to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Bismuth subsalicylate, omega -3 fatty acids, Hypericum perforatum (St Johnâ€™s wort), and wheat bran are not evidence -based recommendations for the management of IBS in any guidelines. Furthermore, wheat bran is a source of insoluble fiber, and soluble fiber is recommended for IBS.
