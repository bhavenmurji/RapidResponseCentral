# Question ITE-2022-013

His CHA2DS2-VASc score is 3 based on his previous history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. He has no major risk factors for bleeding. Which one of the following would be recommended for the prevention of ischemic stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation in this patient?

## Options

**A.** No antithrombotic therapy

**B.** Apixaban (Eliquis), 5 mg twice daily

**C.** Aspirin only, 81 mg daily

**D.** Aspirin only, 325 mg daily

**E.** Aspirin, 81 mg daily, plus full-dose warfarin, with a target INR of 2.0–3.0

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The decision regarding antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation is a careful risk assessment balancing
the reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke against the risk of major bleeding associated with anticoagulants
and antiplatelets. The CHA2DS2-VASc tool is widely used to help weigh these benefits versus potential
harms. Due to the overall benefit of stroke reduction, anticoagulation with either a direct oral anticoagulant
(DOAC) such as apixaban or a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin is recommended in patients with
atrial fibrillation who have a CHA2DS2-VASc score 2. Aspirin monotherapy is considered an ineffective
antithrombotic strategy and inferior to a DOAC or warfarin for preventing thromboembolic events in
patients with atrial fibrillation. Adding aspirin therapy to warfarin does not confer extra benefit and
increases the risk of major bleeding.
