# Question ITE-2024-002

## Question
She does not have any significant medical history other than the gender -affirming 
procedures and her only medication is a transdermal estradiol patch (Climara), 0.05 mg weekly. She is monogamous wit h her cisgender female partner and has never smoked.  
 
Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, which one of the following preventive care 
options should be discussed at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A digital rectal examination
**B)** An anal Papanicolaou smear
**C)** Prostate -specific antigen testing
**D)** Mammography
**E)** Bone density screening

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Continuing warfarin is not recommended prior to elective procedures or surgeries in patients who are taking warfarin for stroke prevention secondary to atrial fibrillation. The BRIDGE trial excluded patients who had an ischemic stroke within the previous 1 2 weeks but included those with more distant strokes. For such patients, cessation of warfarin without bridging with low -molecular -weight heparin or antiplatelet agents is the appropriate management strategy. There is no evidence that using a lower target INR is appropriate.
