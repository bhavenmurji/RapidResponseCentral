# Question ITE-2022-071

You are considering hereditary hemochromatosis as a possible diagnosis. Which one of the following should you order first?

## Options

**A.** A serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation

**B.** Genetic testing for HFE mutations

**C.** T2-weighted MRI for hepatic iron concentration

**D.** A liver biopsy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The initial tests used in the workup for suspected hemochromatosis are a serum ferritin level and
transferrin saturation. A transferrin saturation >45% and a serum ferritin level >300 ng/mL in men or
>200 ng/mL in women are indicative of iron overload and highly suggestive of hereditary
hemochromatosis. A serum iron level is ordered as part of transferrin saturation testing, but an elevated
iron level by itself is not as sensitive or specific as the other tests. Other etiologies of iron overload should
be ruled out, including liver disease, alcohol abuse, and metabolic syndrome. If no secondary etiologies
are found, genetic testing would be appropriate to identify HFE mutations indicating hereditary
hemochromatosis. Genetic testing should not be performed in a patient without iron overload or a family
history of hereditary hemochromatosis. MRI may help determine the risk of developing cirrhosis, and a
liver biopsy is used to determine the amount of liver damage.
