# Question ITE-2022-079

below). She does not have any other medical issues today. Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this rash?

## Options

**A.** Addison’s disease

**B.** An allergic reaction

**C.** Cellulitis

**D.** A chemical burn

**E.** Phytophotodermatitis

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Phytophotodermatitis is an inflammation and/or discoloration of the skin caused by contact with specific
plants followed by exposure to sunlight. Limes are commonly associated with this phenomenon. Addison’s
disease causes generalized hyperpigmentation and has an insidious onset along with other constitutional
symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, and weakness. An allergic reaction would likely be pruritic and a
chemical burn would be expected to be painful. Cellulitis would also be uncomfortable and would likely
be associated with erythema.
