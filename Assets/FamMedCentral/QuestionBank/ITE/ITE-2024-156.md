# Question ITE-2024-156

## Question
A 32 -year-old male presents with frequent episodes of palpitations, sweating, dizziness, and 
paresthesias associated with an impending sense of doom. These symptoms have occurred several times per week and have disrupted his performance at work. After an a ppropriate evaluation, you 
diagnose panic disorder.  
 
Which one of the following would be most appropriate for initial treatment?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bupropion
**B)** Buspirone
**C)** Escitalopram (Lexapro)
**D)** Hydroxyzine (Vistaril)
**E)** Lorazepam (Ativan)

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
The first -line pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder is SSRI and SNRI antidepressant medications (SOR A), including the SSRI escitalopram. Evidence has not shown bupropion or buspirone to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder. Sedating antihi stamines such as hydroxyzine also are not recommended for first -line management of panic disorder because of limited evidence of effectiveness and decreased tolerability due to their anticholinergic effects. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are less effec tive than antidepressants but improve symptoms compared to placebo, but they carry an increased risk for adverse effects including tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, and mortality.
