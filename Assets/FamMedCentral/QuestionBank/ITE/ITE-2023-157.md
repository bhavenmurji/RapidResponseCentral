# Question ITE-2023-157

For a patient presenting for follow-up of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which one of the following findings would be most concerning for progression to multiple myeloma? 58 60 ---

## Options

**A.** A serum albumin level that is more than 1 g/dL below the lower limit of normal

**B.** A serum calcium level that is more than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal

**C.** A hemoglobin level that is 2 g/dL above the upper limit of normal

**D.** The presence of 3 or more RBCs/hpf on microscopic urinalysis

**E.** An osteoblastic lesion seen on a skeletal radiograph

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells, represents 1.6% of all cancer cases and approximately 10% of the hematologic malignancies seen in the United States. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) have a 1% annual risk of progression to MM. Patients who have progressed to MM typically manifest one or more of the classic CRAB findings: calcium (hypercalcemia of >11 mg/dL), renal impairment (a creatinine level >2 mg/dL or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <40 mL/min/1.73 m2), anemia (a hemoglobin level <10 g/dL), and bone involvement (osteolytic lesions, pathologic fractures, and/or severe osteopenia), which represent evidence of end-organ disease. Of the options listed, only hypercalcemia raises concern for progression of MGUS to MM. While patients with MM often have an elevated total serum protein level, the increase is from plasma cellâ€“related proliferation and the resulting monoclonal protein production, not from an increase in albumin. Patients with MM would be expected to have a decrease in the hemoglobin level, not an increase. Renal manifestations typically involve a decrease in the serum creatinine level rather than microscopic hematuria. Finally, bone involvement in MM includes lytic, as opposed to blastic, lesions.
