# Question ITE-2024-123

## Question
A 35 -year-old female presents with a swollen right index finger after accidentally slamming the car 
door on the finger yesterday. She has constant pain of the distal finger but no throbbing under her 
fingernail. On examination the end of the right index fi nger is swollen, and she has a small subungual 
hematoma. She is able to flex and extend the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint with some pain, but 
has normal strength. An x- ray shows a transverse fracture across the distal phalanx that does not 
involve the  joint.  
 
Which one of the following is the optimal treatment plan for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Ice, NSAIDs, and DIP flexion as tolerated
**B)** Draining the subungual hematoma and bandaging the finger
**C)** Buddy taping the finger for 3 –4 weeks
**D)** Splinting the DIP joint in full extension for 4 –6 weeks
**E)** Referral to an orthopedic surgeon

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
A distal phalanx fracture can occur after a crush injury or direct force to the end of the finger. The affected finger will have swelling, bruising, and often a subungual hematoma. Simple fractures can be managed with splinting in extension for 4 –6 weeks with a finger guard or U -shaped aluminum splint. Hematomas that are more than 50% of the nail bed surface can be drained with a hot needle or instrument. Buddy taping is used for minimally angled middle or proximal phalanx fractures that do not involve the joints. A patient who is unable to flex or extend the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, has decreased sensation, or has a complex fracture extending into the joint should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.
