# Question ITE-2022-106

symptoms. An initial laboratory evaluation is significant for the following: HIV viral load                          124,000 copies/mL CD4 lymphocyte count                   289 cells/ μL Hepatitis C antibody                     negative Anti-HBs                              positive Anti-HBc                              positive HBsAg                               negative Renal function is normal. He has an upcoming appointment with the comprehensive HIV clinic to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Which one of the following would be appropriate to recommend today?

## Options

**A.** Prophylactic emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada)

**B.** Prophylactic sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim)

**C.** Hepatitis B vaccine

**D.** Herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix)

**E.** Meningococcal B (MenB) vaccine

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices updated its recommendations in 2022 to
include a two-dose series of recombinant zoster vaccine for all adults age 19 and older with HIV.
Vaccination against meningococcal bacteria A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY) is also recommended, and
meningococcal B (MenB) vaccination is only recommended based (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) on the presence of other risk factors,
including asplenia, complement deficiency, treatment with complement inhibitors, or risk due to outbreaks.
Prophylactic emtricitabine/tenofovir is approved for pre- and postexposure prophylaxis of HIV, but would
not be used alone in the care of patients with established HIV. Pneumocystis jirovecii  prophylaxis, most
commonly with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, is recommended in patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts
<200 cells/ L. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended but would not be necessary for patients such as this
one with natural immunity or confirmed immunity from vaccination.
