# Question ITE-2023-085

For patients with atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation, which one of the following concomitant conditions would indicate a need for treatment with warfarin instead of a direct oral anticoagulant? 31 33 --- 32 34 ---

## Options

**A.** Congestive heart failure

**B.** Diabetes mellitus

**C.** A history of stroke

**D.** Hypertension

**E.** Severe mitral stenosis

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

In general, direct oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban are preferred over warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of at least 3 for women and at least 2 for men. However, if the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, warfarin is preferred.
