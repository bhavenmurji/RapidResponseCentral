# Question ITE-2022-130

should order specific periodic monitoring of his PSA level and

## Options

**A.** no other laboratory studies

**B.** ALT and AST levels

**C.** BUN and creatinine levels

**D.** C-reactive protein level

**E.** hematocrit

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

When testosterone therapy is started, baseline and periodic measurements of PSA and hematocrit should
be performed. If the hematocrit increases to >54% the testosterone dosage should be stopped or decreased
to avoid hemoconcentration. Liver and renal function tests should be monitored routinely with many drugs
but not specifically with testosterone. The C-reactive protein level is not monitored during testosterone
therapy.
