# Question ITE-2024-143

## Question
A 29 -year-old female was recently treated for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She presents 
to your office with recurrence of an itchy rash on her elbow and lower back (shown below).  
 Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Drug eruption
**B)** Pityriasis rosea
**C)** Psoriasis
**D)** Seborrheic dermatitis
**E)** Tinea corporis

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient has a rash with a distribution and appearance that is highly consistent with psoriasis, with thick, well -circumscribed plaques with silvery scale on the lower back and extensor elbows. Drug eruptions can have variable presentations, but this r ash is much more consistent with psoriasis. Pityriasis rosea presents with more diffuse macules and patches with a fine scale. Both psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis can cause itchy red rashes on the scalp, but seborrhea is less frequent on the back and elbows. Tinea corporis is more common in intertriginous areas.
