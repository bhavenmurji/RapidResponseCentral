# Question ITE-2022-092

physician because he was not adequately treating her. She states that she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 1 year ago and is seeking better treatment. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate first-line therapy?

## Options

**A.** Lamotrigine (Lamictal), 25 mg daily

**B.** Lithium, 300 mg twice daily

**C.** Omega-3 fish oil (Lovaza), 4 g daily

**D.** Quetiapine (Seroquel), 50 mg at bedtime

**E.** Cognitive behavioral therapy

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by emotional dysregulation, unstable self-image, and
instability in interpersonal relationships. Patients with borderline personality disorder frequently overvalue
and then rapidly devalue relationships, depending on perceived rejection. Cognitive behavioral therapy,
specifically dialectical behavioral therapy and mentalization-based therapy, has shown the best efficacy in
treating borderline personality disorder (SOR B). Pharmacologic treatments, including mood stabilizers,
fatty acids, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, have been utilized in the treatment of borderline personality
disorder despite limited or low-quality evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]), and would not be considered first-line therapy.
