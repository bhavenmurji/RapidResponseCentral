# Question ITE-2023-164

A 45-year-old male works at a warehouse where he routinely lifts loads weighing more than 25 kg (55 lb). Which one of the following preventive measures has been shown to reduce the likelihood of developing chronic lower back pain?

## Options

**A.** Back braces

**B.** Over-the-counter insoles

**C.** Customized orthoses

**D.** Education on lifting techniques

**E.** Core strengthening exercises

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

There is reliable and consistent evidence to support core strengthening exercises as a preventive measure for low back pain. In contrast, back braces, over-the-counter insoles, customized orthoses, and education on lifting techniques have shown little or no benefit.
