# Question ITE-2024-007

## Question
A 45 -year-old male presents for a health maintenance examination. He has a history of hypertension 
that is well controlled on lisinopril (Zestril).  
 
Based on guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, this patient should be screened 
for which one of the following?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Cardiovascular disease with EKG
**B)** Carotid artery disease with carotid ultrasonography
**C)** Colon cancer with colonoscopy
**D)** Prostate cancer with a prostate -specific antigen level
**E)** Vitamin D deficiency with a vitamin D level

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colon cancer in adults ages 45 –49 (B recommendation) and ages 50 –75 (A recommendation). Neither screening for cardiovascular disease with an EKG nor screening for carotid artery disease with carotid ultrasonography in individuals without symptoms is recommended. Prostate cancer screening with a prostate -specific antigen level can be considered in men ages 55 –69 after discussion of potential benefits and possible harms (C recommendation) with s hared decision -making. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for vitamin D deficiency (I recommendation).
