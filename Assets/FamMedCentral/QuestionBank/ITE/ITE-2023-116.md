# Question ITE-2023-116

An 88-year-old female is admitted to the hospital with a hip fracture after tripping and falling, and her orthopedist recommends surgery. You are consulted for co-management and risk stratification prior to surgery. The patient has a history of controlled blood pressure and had a coronary artery bypass graft 10 years earlier. She is not experiencing any cardiac symptoms or syncope. The most appropriate intervention would be operative management within how many hours?

## Options

**A.** 48

**B.** 60

**C.** 72

**D.** 84

**E.** 96

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons’ clinical practice guideline recommends operative management of a hip fracture within 24–48 hours of injury unless a delay is needed to stabilize comorbidities (SOR C). Early intervention reduces complications, improves pain control, and reduces the duration of hospitalization. 45
