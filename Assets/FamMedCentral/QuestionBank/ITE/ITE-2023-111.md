# Question ITE-2023-111

You diagnose hand-foot-and-mouth disease in a 5-year-old male. His parents ask when he can return to kindergarten. You advise that if he feels well enough to participate, he may return 42 44 ---

## Options

**A.** 5 days after the onset of symptoms

**B.** when afebrile and there are no mouth sores causing drooling

**C.** when afebrile as long as all skin lesions can be covered with a dressing

**D.** when afebrile and all skin lesions have crusted over

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is very common among children younger than 10 years of age, and is very easily spread by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet routes. As the disease is ubiquitous and has a very low complication rate, the CDC recommends allowing children to return to school or day care when they are afebrile, feel well enough to participate, and are not actively drooling with mouth lesions. There is no specific time course that must be followed, and the status of skin lesions does not affect return to school.
