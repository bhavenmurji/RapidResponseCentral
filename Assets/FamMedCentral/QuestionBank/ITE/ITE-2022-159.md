# Question ITE-2022-159

and adopted at birth. She has a history of methamphetamine exposure in utero. She is up to date on vaccinations and is doing well academically. She says she has friends at school and her mother confirms that her teachers report that she interacts well with the other students. Her mother notes, however, that the patient has persistent difficulties with anger and irritability. This behavior has been present since preschool, and while her mother thinks there has been some improvement, she is concerned that it has not resolved. At home, the child has frequent outbursts, often speaks hatefully when upset, refuses to follow instructions, and throws herself on the floor and kicks in frustration at times.

important to evaluate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders, as well
as ODD.
Given the persistence of symptoms and maternal concern in this patient, reassurance alone would not be
