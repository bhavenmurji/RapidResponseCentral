# Question ITE-2023-182

A 58-year-old female sees you to request testing for a possible vitamin D deficiency. She lives independently and has no health problems except for osteoarthritis. Her BMI is 25 kg/m2 and she has no pain or muscle weakness. After discussing the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations regarding screening for vitamin D deficiency, she chooses to be tested. A serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is 18 ng/mL. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step? of supplementation with this laboratory result are unclear because her serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is <20 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is <20 ng/mL

## Options

**A.** Explaining to her that there is no accepted cut-off for deficiency, and that the benefits

**B.** Initiating vitamin D supplementation to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events

**C.** Initiating vitamin D supplementation to decrease the risk of mortality because her serum

**D.** Ordering a 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D study

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

There are unclear benefits of vitamin D supplementation with a total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 18 ng/mL even though this test is considered the best available study of vitamin D status. There are many laboratory assays with poor standardization and no consensus regarding what 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is sufficient or recommended for health optimization. In community-dwelling, nonpregnant individuals without risk factors there is insufficient evidence to support that supplementation decreases all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, or fractures. A 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level would be used to test for rickets and osteomalacia.
