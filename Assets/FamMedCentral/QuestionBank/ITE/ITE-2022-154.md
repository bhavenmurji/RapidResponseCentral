# Question ITE-2022-154

hip pain. Her symptoms began shortly after she started jogging. The pain worsened a week ago after a long car trip. She reports that the pain has been interfering with her sleep quality, particularly if she rests on her right side. You ask her to walk away from her video camera so you can observe her ambulation. You note a Trendelenburg gait with her body shifting to the right side. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Femoroacetabular impingement

**B.** Greater trochanteric pain syndrome

**C.** A hamstring strain

**D.** A labral tear

**E.** Sacroiliac joint dysfunction

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient presents with lateral hip pain and symptoms of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which can
include bursitis as well as gluteus medius tendinopathy or tears. She exhibits a Trendelenburg gait, which
indicates gluteus muscle weakness. Both femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears generally cause
anterior hip pain. Femoroacetabular impingement is one of the most common causes of hip pain in young
adults and is usually caused by a cam deformity and/or a pincer deformity of the hip joint. Labral tears
are usually associated with a history of trauma or sports-related injury. Hamstring injuries and sacroiliac
joint dysfunction generally cause posterior hip pain. Hamstring strains are also associated with a history
of trauma, sports-related injury, or overuse.
