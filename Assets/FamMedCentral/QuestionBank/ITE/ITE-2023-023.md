# Question ITE-2023-023

Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease with pulse oximetry is recommended for 8 10 ---

## Options

**A.** all infants within the first 6 hours of life

**B.** all infants before 24 hours of life

**C.** all infants 24 hours or more after birth

**D.** only infants with clinical signs of hypoxemia

**E.** only infants with a heart murmur

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

All infants, regardless of whether heart murmurs are present, should be screened for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry in the right upper extremity and either of the lower extremities. The ideal time frame to conduct pulse oximetry is 24 hours or more after birth. False-positive results are more likely when testing is performed within the first 24 hours of life. All infants should be screened, not only those with clinical signs of hypoxemia.
