# Question ITE-2024-173

## Question
Which one of the following is a best practice strategy for avoiding the use of stigmatizing or 
judgmental language in the medical record?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Attributing responsibility to patients for their condition
**B)** Documenting when a patient “refuses” a recommendation
**C)** Including socioeconomic status in the “one -liner” about the patient
**D)** Leading with ethnic identifiers
**E)** Using person -first language

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Person -first language focuses on the patient and not the condition and is an important humanizing strategy that should be used in clinical documentation. For example, “a patient with diabetes” is preferred over referring to a patient as “a diabetic.” It is important to avoid blaming the patient by attributing responsibility for their condition to them. Documenting that a patient “refuses” a recommendation carries a negative connotation and it is preferable to use a neutral alternative such “chooses.” Social identifiers such as race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status can be markers of marginalization and trigger unconscious bias. These identifiers should not be used to lead the history of present illness or included in a “one -liner.” Instead, they can be included in the social history if verified by the patient.
