# Question ITE-2022-157

irradiation treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Her past medical history is otherwise significant for allergic rhinitis and GERD. She feels generally well after treatment. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which one of the following should be performed to monitor for complications from radiation?

## Options

**A.** No routine follow-up surveillance

**B.** Parathyroid hormone levels

**C.** Swallow studies

**D.** Carotid artery ultrasonography

**E.** Neck CT

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Patients who have been treated with neck irradiation for lymphoma require follow-up surveillance with
carotid artery ultrasonography every 10 years. There is evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) that asymptomatic carotid artery disease
is more common in patients who have been treated with radiation for Hodgkin’s lymphoma compared to
the general population.
The risk of thyroid cancer is increased by neck irradiation. Hypothyroidism is also a common complication
from neck irradiation, and a TSH level should be measured annually for up to 5 years. For patients who
have completed treatment for lymphoma, additional surveillance laboratory studies include a
comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting glucose level, and CBC. Patients with a history of chest or axillary
irradiation should receive annual mammography screening starting 8–10 years after treatment or at age 40,
whichever comes first. Breast MRI may be appropriate for patients who received chest irradiation
treatment between ages 10 and 30. Parathyroid hormone lev...
