# Question ITE-2023-191

For a patient with a borderline low serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) level, which one of the following additional findings is the most sensitive and specific for a true vitamin B12 deficiency state?

## Options

**A.** High methylmalonic acid level

**B.** Low ferritin level

**C.** Low folate level

**D.** Low homocysteine level

**E.** Negative intrinsic factor antibodies

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

In some patients, a low-normal serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) level can mask a clinical vitamin B12 deficiency state. Patients with low-normal vitamin B12 levels who are truly vitamin B12 deficient manifest elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels, due to the role that vitamin B12 plays as a cofactor in converting MMA to succinyl coenzyme A and in converting homocysteine to methionine. A high MMA level is slightly more sensitive and specific for vitamin B12 deficiency than is an elevated homocysteine level, as homocysteine also may be increased due to folate deficiency. A low or normal homocysteine (or MMA) level would render vitamin B12 deficiency less likely, not more likely. A low ferritin level indicates iron deficiency, not vitamin B12 deficiency. Although vitamin B12 deficiency leads to a pseudofolate deficiency due to the vitamin B12 role in converting 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, a low serum folate level may represent a folate deficiency without an associated vitamin B12 deficiency. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies suggests pernicious anemia with a 95% positive predictive value, although an isolated negative intrinsic factor antibody result in the setting of a low-normal vitamin B12 level neither confirms nor excludes a vitamin B12 deficiency state.
