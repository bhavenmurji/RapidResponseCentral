# Question ITE-2023-069

You are on a commercial aircraft at cruising altitude. One of the passengers rises from his seat and passes out on the aisle floor beside you. You offer your services as a physician and the flight attendant arrives at the patientâ€™s side. You find the scene safe and the patient unresponsive, not breathing, and without a carotid pulse. You request the automated external defibrillator (AED). The most appropriate next step would be to

## Options

**A.** attach the AED

**B.** begin chest compressions at a rate of 100/min

**C.** give two slow breaths using the mouth-to-mouth technique

**D.** give two slow breaths with a bag-valve mask

**E.** tell the flight crew to land as soon as possible

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The American Heart Association recommends starting immediate chest compressions when a lack of responsiveness, pulse, and breath are confirmed after 10 seconds. This can be followed by ventilation attempts in a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 breaths. In the most recent guidelines, the traditional A-B-C model has been revised to C-A-B to emphasize the early institution of compressions. It is appropriate to attach the automated external defibrillator (AED) as soon as it arrives, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Two minutes of good-quality compressions are required before analyzing the cardiac rhythm with the AED. A medical professional on board can make a recommendation to land, but the pilot will follow established protocols for in-flight medical emergencies. The flight crew will be in contact with an emergency consulting agency on the ground within minutes of an in-flight medical emergency.
