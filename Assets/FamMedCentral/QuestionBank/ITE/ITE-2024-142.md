# Question ITE-2024-142

## Question
A 62 -year-old male presents to your office with chest pain that began after he ate his usual breakfast 
of bacon and eggs this morning. He describes the pain as a substernal tightness that worsens with 
activity and radiates to his left arm. He reports dyspnea and nausea but no emesis.  
 
On exa mination the patient is diaphoretic and appears to be in slight distress. He has a temperature of 
37.0 °C (98.6 °F), a pulse rate of 106 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 22/min and nonlabored, a blood 
pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 9 2% on room air. The lungs are clear, and 
the heart is regular without any murmurs. Examination of the abdomen is notable for tenderness to 
palpation in the right upper quadrant, normal bowel sounds, no rebound or guarding, and a negative 
Murphy sign. Exami nation of the extremities reveals no edema and 1+ pedal pulses. A neurologic 
examination shows no focal deficits and a normal gait. An EKG shows a left bundle branch block that was 

## Answer Choices
**A)** A high -sensitivity cardiac troponin level in your office
**B)** Coronary CT angiography
**C)** Referral to a cardiologist for treadmill stress testing
**D)** Transportation to a hospital capable of urgent coronary intervention

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient has new -onset chest pain with symptoms typical of coronary artery disease and needs urgent evaluation with coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He has a new left bundle branch block indicative of acute coronary syndrome and should be emergently transported to a facility that can perform urgent coronary angiography and further intervention as needed, including PCI. Once the patient has been identified as having acute coronary syndrome, transfer should not be delayed while waiting for further cardiac testing. Outpatient laboratory testing, coronary CT angiography, and cardiac stress testing would not be appropriate in this situation.
