# Question ITE-2022-021

diagnosed with Î²-thalassemia major at birth and has been transfusion-dependent since early childhood. His microcytic anemia is stable with blood transfusions every 4 weeks, but his most recent DEXA scan indicates an advancement from osteopenia to osteoporosis. In addition to bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D, which one of the following medications may improve his bone density?

## Options

**A.** Hydroxyurea (Hydrea)

**B.** Vitamin C

**C.** Zinc

**D.** Deferoxamine (Desferal)

**E.** Luspatercept (Reblozyl)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

In addition to bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D, zinc supplementation is recommended to improve
bone density in patients with thalassemia and osteoporosis (SOR C). Though hydroxyurea is an indicated
therapy to minimize the frequency of blood transfusions needed in transfusion-dependent thalassemia, it
does not improve bone density (SOR C). Vitamin C supplementation does not improve bone health in
patients with thalassemia and osteoporosis. Deferoxamine infusions are indicated when ferritin levels are
>1000 ng/mL in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia to reduce iron overload (SOR C).
Luspatercept reduced transfusion burden by 33% in a phase 3, randomized study but is not indicated to
improve bone density.
