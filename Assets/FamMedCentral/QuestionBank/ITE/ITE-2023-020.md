# Question ITE-2023-020

A 69-year-old male presents 30 hours after the onset of difficulty speaking, right-sided facial droop, and marked weakness in his right arm and leg, with the arm more affected than the leg. You diagnose an ischemic stroke of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Noncontrast CT of the head reveals hypodensity in the area of the brain supplied by that artery, and CT angiography reveals occlusion of the left proximal MCA. Which one of the following treatments would be indicated at this time?

## Options

**A.** Aspirin daily

**B.** Clopidogrel (Plavix) plus aspirin

**C.** Intravenous alteplase (Activase)

**D.** Intravenous tenecteplase (TNKase)

**E.** Thrombectomy of the MCA

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The benefit of interventions for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is time dependent. A 21-day course of clopidogrel plus aspirin, followed by clopidogrel alone is indicated for patients with mild, non-debilitating stroke who do not require other interventions. Intravenous alteplase is most beneficial if given within 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms. In some selected patients, this time window may extend up to 9 hours. Tenecteplase is still experimental. Thrombectomy should be performed within 6 hours if possible, although select patients may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after onset of symptoms. This patient meets none of the above criteria, so he should be started on daily aspirin.
