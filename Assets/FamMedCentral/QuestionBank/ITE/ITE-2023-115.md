# Question ITE-2023-115

A randomized, controlled study of 300 participants tested the effectiveness of a new medication to reduce breast cancer–related deaths. Within 2 years of treatment, 15 out of 150 participants with breast cancer in the treatment group died, while 60 out of the 150 participants in the control group died. Based on this study, what is the number needed to treat to prevent one breast cancer–related death?

## Options

**A.** 2

**B.** 3

**C.** 5

**D.** 10

**E.** 15

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The number needed to treat (NNT) is the number of patients who need to be treated with a specific medication to prevent one negative outcome or to achieve one positive outcome. It is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference in risk between participants in the control group and the treatment group. The closer the NNT is to 1, the more effective the new treatment is versus the placebo. Event rate in the control group (CER) = 60/150 = 0.4 Event rate in the experimental group (EER) = 15/150 = 0.1 Absolute risk reduction (ARR) = CER – EER = 0.4 – 0.1 = 0.3 NNT = 1/ARR = 3.33
