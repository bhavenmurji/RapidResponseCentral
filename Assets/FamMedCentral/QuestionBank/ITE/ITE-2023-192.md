# Question ITE-2023-192

Which one of the following is associated with a shorter duration of active labor and reduction of risk for cesarean section or operative vaginal delivery? 70 72 ---

## Options

**A.** Admission to the labor and delivery unit during the latent phase of labor

**B.** Amniotomy prior to the onset of active labor

**C.** The use of high-dose rather than low-dose oxytocin (Pitocin)

**D.** Membrane stripping prior to the onset of labor

**E.** Using an individual labor support person (doula)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

A Cochrane review of more than 15,000 patients demonstrated that a trained personal labor support person (doula) was associated with both shortened labor and with reduction of cesarean or operative (i.e., vacuum, forceps) vaginal delivery (SOR A). These patients also reported greater satisfaction with labor and delivery when a doula was in attendance. Admission to the labor and delivery unit during the latent phase of labor, prior to 4- to 5-cm dilatation and 80% effacement, was associated with higher rates of cesarean section. Amniotomy and membrane stripping are not associated with shorter labor or reduced rates of cesarean section. High-dose oxytocin induction was no better than low-dose oxytocin induction regarding duration of labor or the rate of cesarean section, and low-dose oxytocin induction was associated with fewer contractions and a more comfortable labor experience.
