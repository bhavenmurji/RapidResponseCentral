# Question ITE-2023-026

A 60-year-old male presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain. His medical and surgical histories are remarkable only for a history of hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril (Zestril), and a screening colonoscopy 5 years ago that showed diverticulosis without polyps. He is afebrile, and a physical examination is notable only for mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant without peritoneal signs. A urinalysis is normal. You diagnose mild diverticulitis. Which one of the following would be indicated at this time? 9 11 --- 10 12 ---

## Options

**A.** Rest and clear liquids

**B.** Avoidance of seeds, nuts, and popcorn

**C.** Abdominal CT

**D.** Referral for colonoscopy

**E.** Hospital admission for intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

In patients with mild diverticulitis, outpatient management with rest and oral clear liquids is preferred. Avoidance of seeds, nuts, and popcorn does not reduce recurrence rates. CT of the abdomen may be indicated if the diagnosis is uncertain or if complications are suspected. Colonoscopy is contraindicated acutely and is only necessary for follow-up when age-appropriate cancer screening is indicated, or in cases of complicated disease. Antibiotics may not be necessary in all cases, and hospital admission is unnecessary for mild cases.
