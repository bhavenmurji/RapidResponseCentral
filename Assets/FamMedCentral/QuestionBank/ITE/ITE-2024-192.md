# Question ITE-2024-192

## Question
A 39 -year-old female presents with a sudden onset of palpitations. Her vital signs include a blood 
pressure of 114/68 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 166 beats/min. She is cooperative and alert. An EKG 
shows regular narrow complex tachycardia with normal intervals. She has tried vagal maneuvers with 
no improvement.  
 
Which one of the following would be the mos t appropriate treatment at this time?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Adenosine
**B)** Atropine
**C)** Diltiazem (Cardizem)
**D)** Metoprolol
**E)** Synchronized cardioversion Item #191 Item #191

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
If vagal maneuvers are not effective in the management of stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the most appropriate next step is treatment with intravenous adenosine at an initial dose of 6 mg. Atropine is a treatment option for bradycardia, particul arly in the setting of heart block. Diltiazem or metoprolol may be used acutely in atrial fibrillation or in the prevention of SVT. Synchronized cardioversion is indicated in patients with SVT who become hypotensive or unresponsive.
