# Question ITE-2023-153

Since the United States began fortifying grains with folic acid, which one of the following birth defects has declined?

## Options

**A.** Anencephaly

**B.** Cleft lip

**C.** Down syndrome

**D.** Omphalocele

**E.** Tetralogy of Fallot

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

In the United States birth defects affect 1 in 33 infants and are the leading cause of infant mortality. The CDC tracks data on birth defects to better understand genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors and to direct resources and develop interventions for appropriate populations. Most causes of birth defects are unknown. However, adequate folic acid intake during pregnancy can reduce the risk of neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida. There has been a 28% decline in anencephaly since the United States began fortifying grains with folic acid. 59 Cleft lip and cleft palate are associated with maternal smoking, diabetes mellitus, and the use of antiseizure medications such as topiramate and valproic acid during the first trimester. Down syndrome is associated with maternal age over 35. It is worth noting, however, that because most pregnancies occur in women under the age of 35, the majority of babies born with Down syndrome also occur in mothers younger than 35. Omphalocele is associated with maternal smoking, alcohol use, SSRI use, and obesity. The cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, but like all other birth defects it is likely associated with a combination of genes, maternal behavioral, and environmental exposures.
