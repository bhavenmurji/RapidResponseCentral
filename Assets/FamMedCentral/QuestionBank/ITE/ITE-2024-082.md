# Question ITE-2024-082

## Question
A physically active 25 -year-old male presents with foot pain after an injury. X -rays are obtained.  
 
A proximal fracture at which one of the following metatarsals would be at the greatest risk for 
nonunion?

## Answer Choices
**A)** First
**B)** Second
**C)** Third
**D)** Fourth
**E)** Fifth

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures are categorized by zones. Zone 2 is located at the metaphyseal -diaphyseal junction at the fourth and fifth metatarsal joint. Zone 3 fractures are located at the proximal 1.5 cm of the diaphysis. Because of poor blood supply, fractures in zone 2 or zone 3 of the fifth metatarsal have a risk for slow healing and nonunion. Surgical management of these fractures should be considered in active patients to decrease the risk for nonunion (SOR B).
