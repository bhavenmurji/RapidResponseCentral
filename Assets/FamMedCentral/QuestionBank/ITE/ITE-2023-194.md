# Question ITE-2023-194

A 45-year-old female comes to your clinic for follow-up of pruritus. She notes swelling in her distal fingers. She reports that her fingers become pale and numb, and they tingle when exposed to cold. An examination shows multiple telangiectasias and bilateral thickening and swelling of her fingers. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are elevated. An antinuclear antibody titer is positive at 1:320 with a nucleolar pattern. Anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies and anti-Smith antibodies are negative. Antiribonucleoprotein antibodies, anti–Sjögren-syndrome-related antigen A and B, anticardiolipin, and lupus anticoagulant are negative. Anticentromere and anti–Scl-70 antibodies are positive. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Dermatomyositis

**B.** Mixed connective tissue disease

**C.** Sjögren syndrome

**D.** Systemic lupus erythematosus

**E.** Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This patient presents with symptoms and signs that are more common in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). She has a positive antinuclear antibody titer with a nucleolar pattern, and further testing shows anticentromere and anti–Scl-70 antibodies that are indicative of systemic sclerosis. Dermatomyositis is associated with muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase levels. Sjögren syndrome typically presents with dry eyes, a dry mouth, and positive Sjögren antibodies with anti–Sjögren-syndrome-related antigen A and B. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is more commonly associated with joint pain and a butterfly rash with positive anti–double-stranded and anti-Smith antibodies. Mixed connective tissue disease has symptoms that overlap with SLE and scleroderma including joint symptoms and myositis. In mixed connective tissue disease, an antinuclear antibody titer and antiribonucleoprotein antibodies would likely be positive.
