# Question ITE-2023-200

A 32-year-old male sees you for a routine health maintenance examination in the fall and you recommend influenza vaccination. He mentions a previous possible allergic reaction to eggs. Upon further questioning, you determine that he had hives and no other symptoms after exposure to eggs. Which one of the following should you recommend at this time? vaccine 73

## Options

**A.** Avoiding any influenza vaccine

**B.** Receiving any influenza vaccine

**C.** Pretreatment with diphenhydramine (Benadryl Allergy) before receiving an influenza

**D.** Prophylactic oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for the influenza season

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Patients whose only allergic reaction to egg is hives can receive any influenza vaccine. Patients with more serious allergic reactions can also receive any influenza vaccine, but the vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting with supervision by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage allergic reactions. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine before receiving an influenza vaccine is not recommended. Prophylaxis with oseltamivir should be reserved for high-risk populations who are unable to be vaccinated.
