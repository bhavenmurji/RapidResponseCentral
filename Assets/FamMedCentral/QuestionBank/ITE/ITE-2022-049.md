## Options

**A.** delirium

**B.** myocardial infarction

**C.** suicidality

**D.** venous thromboembolism

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

In March 2020, the FDA upgraded its warning label for montelukast to a boxed warning (black box warning) based on the trends for all neuropsychiatric adverse events, including suicidality, associated with montelukast use reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database from the date of FDA approval in February 1998 through May 2019 (SOR B). The boxed warning does not indicate an increased risk of delirium, myocardial infarction, or venous thromboembolism.
