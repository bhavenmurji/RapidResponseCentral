## Question
A 30 -year-old male comes to your office because of a nonpainful lump in his genitalia that has been 
present for a few years. He shares that he and his partner have been trying to conceive for 2 years. On 
examination you note a nontender “bag of worms” mass  in the left scrotum.  
 
This patient’s condition is concerning for which one of the following reasons?

## Answer Choices
**A)** It may become painful
**B)** It may be contributing to his infertility
**C)** It is associated with a higher risk for testicular cancer
**D)** It is indicative of an inguinal hernia
**E)** It requires treatment with antibiotics

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Varicoceles appear and feel like a “bag of worms” on palpation and are usually located in the left scrotum. This condition is benign and does not require treatment. However, varicoceles can cause low sperm count and contribute to infertility. The different ial diagnosis of scrotal mass includes varicocele, testicular cancer, epididymitis, inguinal hernia, hydrocele, and epidermoid cyst.
