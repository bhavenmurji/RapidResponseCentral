# Question ITE-2024-127

## Question
A 72 -year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with a 2 -day history of nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea. The symptoms developed after the recent repair of an inguinal hernia, and his 
surgeon advised him to come to the ED. The patient has a history of chronic heart disease, 
hypertension, and diabetes mellitus with kidney disease. His medications include atorvastatin 
(Lipitor), amlodipine (Nor vasc), and dapagliflozin (Farxiga). He does not drink alcohol or use illicit 
drugs. On presentation he is lucid and making jokes with the staff. His vital signs in the ED include a 
blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg, a heart rate of 110 beats/min, and an oxyge n saturation of 96% on 
room air. Physical examination findings are unremarkable. He receives intravenous ondansetron, 4 
mg, and laboratory studies are pending.  
 
Several hours later, the patient appears drowsy and has difficulty focusing. He fluctuates betw een 
lethargy and rambling about unrelated topics. Despite conserv

## Answer Choices
**A)** Diazepam (Valium)
**B)** Haloperidol
**C)** Lorazepam (Ativan)
**D)** with a 2 -day history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The symptoms developed after the recent repair of an inguinal hernia, and his surgeon advised him to come to the ED. The patient has a history 
**E)** Sertraline (Zoloft)

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
This patient’s symptoms meet the DSM -5 criteria for delirium related to his emergency department visit. Delirium is characterized by an acute disturbance in cognition, awareness, and attention that deviates from the patient’s baseline cognition, fluctuates in severity, and develops within hours to days. Delirium has 3 subtypes: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed. An accurate diagnosis is vital to prevent inappropriate treatments, increased morbidity and mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. It is among the most common complications in hospitalized adults age 65 and older, especially among those who have undergone surgery. Patients with delirium have an increased risk for death in the following year. While the pathophysiology of delirium is not well under stood, multiple comorbidities, older age, poor functional status, polypharmacy, and recent surgery are all independent risk factors. Symptoms can overlap with other diseases and a comprehensive history and physical examination are essential for a timely di agnosis. Prevention using a multidisciplinary approach is the optimal management for delirium. Nonpharmacologic interventions are the foundation of delirium management, and no medications are approved by the FDA for its treatment. However, when indicated, second -generation antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, are preferred over haloperidol because they have fewer side effects and a faster onset of action. The benzodiazepines lorazepam and midazolam may be given parenterally if delirium is attributed to alcohol consumption, uncontrollable seizure activity, or hypnotic drug withdrawal, but oral diazepam is not indicated. Trazodone may be used as an alternative treatment, but sertraline would not be appropriate.
