# Question ITE-2024-061

## Question
In patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, which one of the following medications is most 
effective for the treatment of midsleep awakening due to hyperarousal or nightmares?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Amitriptyline
**B)** Clonazepam (Klonopin)
**C)** Fluoxetine (Prozac)
**D)** Prazosin (Minipress)
**E)** Extended -release venlafaxine (Effexor XR)

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
The Î±-blocker prazosin can be effective in the treatment of midsleep awakening due to hyperarousal or nightmares by decreasing sympathetic nervous tone. Due to their toxicity profiles, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are usually not initiat ed in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) until multiple first -line treatments have failed. Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam are generally avoided in patients with PTSD due to potential misuse and chronic long -term effects. SSRIs such as f luoxetine and SNRIs such as venlafaxine are the most effective pharmacologic treatments for overall reduction of PTSD symptoms. However, they are not used specifically for nighttime trauma -related nightmares.
