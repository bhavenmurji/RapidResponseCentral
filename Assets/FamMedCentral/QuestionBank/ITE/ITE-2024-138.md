# Question ITE-2024-138

## Question
A male patient is brought to your office by his adult granddaughter due to concerns that he has had a 
stroke. He was found with left arm and leg weakness 3 days ago, and he had fallen several times. His 
symptoms resolved after the first day. The patient dr inks and smokes heavily. He has a history of 
traumatic brain injury with prolonged seizure from a fall while intoxicated 10 years ago, and he has 
been taking phenytoin (Dilantin) since that time.  
  
An oral examination is significant for very poor dentitio n and a healing mucosal injury to the 
posterior left side of his tongue. Noncontrast CT of the head shows no hemorrhage, mass, or sign of 
ischemia, but reveals mild encephalomalacia in the right cerebral hemisphere.  
 
Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Conversion disorder
**B)** Hemiplegic migraine
**C)** Hypoglycemia
**D)** Multiple sclerosis
**E)** Postictal paralysis (Todd paralysis)

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
This patient’s presentation is most consistent with postictal paralysis, also known as Todd paralysis. His history of seizures associated with a brain injury, the prolonged nature of his symptoms, the evidence of tongue biting on examination, and the absen ce of signs of stroke on CT all support this diagnosis. Postictal neurologic findings account for approximately 20% of suspected strokes in the emergency department. There is no history to support a diagnosis of conversion disorder or hypoglycemia in this patient. Hemiplegic migraine is generally accompanied by headache, and rarely presents in older adults. Multiple sclerosis symptoms would be expected to persist.
