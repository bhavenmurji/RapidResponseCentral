# Question ITE-2023-062

You are treating a patient for hypertension and opt to start an ACE inhibitor. Six weeks later the patient’s blood pressure is at goal, but the serum creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.2 mg/dL (N 0.7–1.0). Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?

## Options

**A.** Continuing the ACE inhibitor with close monitoring of renal function

**B.** Discontinuing the ACE inhibitor immediately

**C.** Ordering ultrasonography to evaluate for renal artery stenosis

**D.** Referring the patient to a nephrologist

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The renal protective effects of ACE inhibitors have been shown to be so efficacious in long-term trials as to warrant tolerating up to a 30% increase in baseline serum creatinine level within the first 6–8 weeks of therapy, assuming blood pressure goals are reached. The degree of long-term renal protection is a high priority in patients with diabetes mellitus, but this is not part of the decision-making process for cessation of ACE inhibitors. Many patients with a severe increase in serum creatinine levels have renal artery stenosis and may require renal artery ultrasonography, and ACE inhibitors would need to be stopped in these patients.
