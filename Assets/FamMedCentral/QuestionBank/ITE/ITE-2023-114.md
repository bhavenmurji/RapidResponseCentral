# Question ITE-2023-114

You are instructing a new medical assistant in preordering laboratory studies for upcoming patients. You have a series of patients with appointments for physical examinations in the next week. Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, which one of the following patients should have a screening fasting glucose level or hemoglobin A1c? 43 45 ---

## Options

**A.** A 24-year-old female with a BMI of 26 kg/m2

**B.** A 36-year-old male with a BMI of 27 kg/m2

**C.** A 52-year-old female with a BMI of 22 kg/m2

**D.** A 72-year-old male with a BMI of 32 kg/m2

**E.** An 84-year-old female with a BMI of 40 kg/m2

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all nonpregnant adults ages 35–70 who are overweight (BMI 25 kg/m2) or obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) be screened for diabetes mellitus and prediabetes with a fasting glucose level, hemoglobin A1c, or glucose tolerance test (B recommendation). In 2021, the age of screening was decreased from 40 to 35. In addition to the above recommendations, patients with a family history of diabetes or a personal history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome should be considered for screening at a younger age. In patients who belong to groups with high rates of diabetes such as American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian American, Black, Hispanic/Latino, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, screening can also start at a younger age. The recommended interval for screening is every 3 years. Routine screening for prediabetes and diabetes in persons over the age of 70 is not a current recommendation. While the risk of prediabetes and diabetes increases with age, patients older than 70 with prediabetes have a low likelihood of progressing to diabetes. More commonly, they either maintain prediabetes status or regress to normoglycemia (SOR B).
