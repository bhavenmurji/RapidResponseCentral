# Question ITE-2022-115

he has not yet received the recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix). Which one of the following approaches is most likely to result in your patient accepting this immunization?

## Options

**A.** “Are there any immunizations you would like today?”

**B.** “You have been a bit negligent on obtaining your shingles vaccine. May we give that

**C.** “You have not yet received your shingles vaccine. May we give that to you before you

**D.** “You have not yet received your shingles vaccine. We are preparing to administer that

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Employing a presumptive approach rather than a participatory approach significantly increases the
likelihood that a patient, parent, or guardian will accept a recommended vaccine. This strategy implies that
accepting the immunization is the usual or normal choice. The correct option in this scenario presumes the
patient will accept the immunization, while the remainder of the options ask if they will.
