# Question ITE-2022-053

diarrhea, and malaise. She is undergoing treatment for breast cancer and her last chemotherapy treatment was 2 weeks ago. On examination her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), her heart rate is 120 beats/min, her blood pressure is 124/68 mm Hg, her respiratory rate is 24/min, and her oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. You order stat laboratory studies, a chest radiograph, a urinalysis, and blood cultures. A CBC reveals a WBC count of 1200/mm3 (N 4800–10,800), 34% neutrophils, 4% bands, and 48% lymphocytes. A COVID-19 rapid antigen test is negative. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point?

## Options

**A.** No treatment until results are available for the remainder of the laboratory studies, chest

**B.** Oral acetaminophen, 1000 mg

**C.** Empiric oral high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)

**D.** Empiric intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Febrile neutropenia is a relatively common complication of chemotherapy. It usually occurs within 6 weeks
of a chemotherapy treatment. It is defined as a single oral temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F) or a sustained
temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) for at least 1 hour in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
<500 cells/mm. This patient’s ANC is 456 cells/mm. Such patients should be presumed to have a bacterial
infection. For patients who meet the criteria for febrile neutropenia, guidelines recommend administration
of empiric intravenous antibiotics within an hour of presentation. Early administration of intravenous
antibiotics has been shown to reduce the potential 11% mortality rate of febrile neutropenia (SOR B).
Once the remainder of the laboratory results are available, a decision can be made about inpatient versus
outpatient treatment in consultation with the patient’s oncologist, but initial treatment should not be
delayed. The patient may benefit symptomatically from aceta...
