# Question ITE-2022-105

floor at her home. They state that she has been confused and not acting like herself for the past 5–7 days. She lives independently and cares for herself, and she is active in a senior church group. The patient is unable to explain why she was on the floor, so the history is obtained from the family. There are no other associated symptoms and no known inciting incident. There have been no recent medication changes and the family is unaware of any fever or chills. The patient has not had episodes like this in the past. Her past medical history is notable for controlled blood pressure and a TIA several years ago with no residual neurologic deficit or impairment. A physical examination is negative except for her confusion, and there are no focal neurologic findings. Imaging shows no acute process. Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?

## Options

**A.** Alzheimer’s disease

**B.** Delirium

**C.** Ischemic stroke

**D.** Mild neurocognitive disorder

**E.** Vascular dementia

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

This patient presents with acute altered mental status. Delirium should always be considered in this setting
because it is both common and frequently overlooked (SOR C). There are multiple potential causes of this
patient’s acute altered mental status, including but not limited to systemic infections, metabolic
disturbances, medications, systemic conditions, and central nervous system insults such as ischemic stroke.
The clinical examination does not indicate the focal neurologic changes of a stroke, and this patient’s TIA
was several years ago with no subsequent chronic cognitive changes.
The history and examination in this case do not suggest the presence of chronic cognitive changes
indicative of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, mild neurocognitive disorder, or vascular dementia.
Alzheimer’s disease has an insidious and gradual onset of cognitive symptoms. In vascular dementia, the
symptoms begin after cerebrovascular events. Importantly, in the setting of acute mental status...
