# Question ITE-2022-180

a cough with increased sputum volume. After appropriate evaluation, you diagnose an acute COPD exacerbation. According to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, which one of the following additional factors would provide the strongest indication for treatment with antibiotics?

## Options

**A.** A decline in oxygen saturation from baseline

**B.** Diffuse wheezing on lung auscultation

**C.** A fever

**D.** Increased sputum purulence

**E.** Leukocytosis

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

COPD exacerbations, when caused by an infectious agent, may be bacterial or viral. The Global Initiative
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines support the use of antibiotics in patients with
an acute COPD exacerbation with the three cardinal symptoms of increased dyspnea, increased sputum
volume, and increased sputum purulence; in patients with increased sputum purulence and one of the other
cardinal symptoms; and in patients who require invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Hypoxemia
and fever, although often seen in the setting of COPD exacerbations, do not provide as strong an indication
for treatment with antibiotics. Diffuse wheezing is a hallmark examination finding that is present in most
COPD exacerbations, regardless of the underlying cause. Leukocytosis is a relatively nonspecific marker
for acute inflammation and may be seen with either viral or bacterial etiologies. Serum biomarkers such
as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin have yielded controv...
