# Question ITE-2022-008

first-line treatment of urethritis in a 24-year-old male who weighs 152 kg (335 lb), when nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for gonorrhea is positive and Chlamydia  testing is negative?

## Options

**A.** One dose of ceftriaxone, 1 g intramuscularly

**B.** One dose of ceftriaxone, 500 mg intramuscularly, plus one dose of azithromycin

**C.** One dose of ceftriaxone, 500 mg intramuscularly, plus doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice

**D.** One dose of gentamicin, 240 mg intramuscularly, plus one dose of azithromycin, 2 g

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

In 2020, the CDC updated its treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections. The recommended first-line
therapy for patients weighing >150 kg (330 lb) with gonococcal urethritis is one dose of ceftriaxone, 1
g intramuscularly. One dose of ceftriaxone, 500 mg intramuscularly, is recommended for those weighing
<150 kg. Patients presenting with an unknown cause of urethritis, such as before urine or urethral nucleic
acid amplification test results are known, should be prescribed a combination of one dose of ceftriaxone,
500 mg intramuscularly (1 g if >150 kg), and doxycycline, 100 mg orally for 7 days. Azithromycin, 1
g orally as a single dose, may be used as an alternative to doxycycline for treatment of chlamydial
infection, but it is no longer the preferred agent in nonpregnant adults and adolescents. Intramuscular
gentamicin is inferior to intramuscular ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhea, even when used in
combination with oral azithromycin (SOR B).
