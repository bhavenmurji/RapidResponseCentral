# Question ITE-2023-064

A 65-year-old female with end-stage renal disease, who has been on dialysis for 2 years, presents for a health maintenance examination. She has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension and does not want to be considered for renal transplantation. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate cancer screening for this patient?

## Options

**A.** No screening

**B.** A skin survey

**C.** A Papanicolaou smear

**D.** Mammography

**E.** Colonoscopy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Routine cancer screening is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease with limited life expectancy who are not candidates for kidney transplantation. In the Choosing Wisely campaign, the American Society of Nephrology recommends avoiding routine cancer screenings for patients who are receiving dialysis who are not candidates for kidney transplantation. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and risks of visual skin examination for skin cancer screening.
