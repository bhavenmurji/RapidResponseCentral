# Question ITE-2022-084

apnea (OSA) presents for follow-up after a sleep study. She was unable to tolerate positive pressure therapy. Her OSA could be most effectively addressed by which one of the following interventions?

## Options

**A.** Use of a nasal dilator device

**B.** A positional sleep alarm to avoid the supine position

**C.** Clonidine, 0.1 mg orally before bedtime

**D.** Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty

**E.** Bariatric surgery

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that, if left untreated, can be associated with other
serious health conditions such as atrial fibrillation, depression, heart failure, and stroke. Positive pressure
therapy is effective and considered the first-line treatment for OSA, although some patients are unable to
tolerate this therapy. In obese patients with OSA, bariatric surgery has been shown to reliably result in
improvement in >75% of patients and result in remission in 40% of patients after 2 years. Nasal dilator
devices and pharmacologic interventions such as clonidine have not been shown to improve symptoms or
to be effective for treatment. Positional therapy is not recommended as a long-term solution for severe
OSA due to poor long-term compliance. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support oral procedures
such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty as primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) interventions for OSA.
