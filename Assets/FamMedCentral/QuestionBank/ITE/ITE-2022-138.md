# Question ITE-2022-138

but recently attended a party where others were smoking it. How long after passive exposure to cannabis smoke can an otherwise cannabis-naïve person test positive for it on a drug screen?

## Options

**A.** Never

**B.** Up to 24 hours

**C.** 3 days

**D.** 1 week

**E.** 1 month

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

A urine drug screen may be positive for cannabis for up to 24 hours after exposure to secondhand cannabis
smoke in an enclosed space. The urine drug screen can be positive for 4–5 days after a single use of
cannabis and for a month after cessation in someone who uses it daily.
