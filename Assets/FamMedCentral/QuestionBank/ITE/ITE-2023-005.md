# Question ITE-2023-005

6 million/mm3 (N

## Options



## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

The initial first-line pharmacologic therapy for temporomandibular disorders is naproxen. Cyclobenzaprine may also be added if there is evidence of muscle spasm (A recommendation). If this is unsuccessful, other options include a trial of amitriptyline or gabapentin. Opioid therapy is not appropriate first-line treatment for temporomandibular disorders. Corticosteroid injections should be avoided due to potential cartilage damage (B recommendation).
