# Question ITE-2024-014

## Question
A 32 -year-old female comes to your office with her husband after a recent weeklong episode of 
elevated mood and energy that meets the diagnostic criteria for a manic episode. They both say that 
she has never had any episodes of depression, low mood, or anhedonia.  
This patientâ€™s presentation is most consistent with which one of the following disorders?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bipolar I
**B)** Bipolar II
**C)** Borderline personality
**D)** Cyclothymic
**E)** Disruptive mood dysregulation

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Bipolar I disorder does not require a history of a major depressive episode and may be diagnosed and treated based on just 1 manic episode. The diagnosis of bipolar II disorder requires at least 1 hypomanic and 1 major depressive episode. Borderline person ality disorder may coexist with bipolar I disorder but the diagnosis is based on the presence of unstable personal relationships and severe impulsivity. Cyclothymic disorder presents with a history of both hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a condition diagnosed between the ages of 6 and 18, characterized by severe recurrent outbursts of temper.
