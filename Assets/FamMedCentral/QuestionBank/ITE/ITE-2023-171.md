# Question ITE-2023-171

A 45-year-old nurse presents with a 3-week history of heel pain that is worse at the end of a workday. She reports that there has not been any trauma. An examination is significant for tenderness inferior to the lateral calcaneus extending below the malleolus to the lateral midfoot. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Achilles tendinopathy

**B.** Lisfranc arthropathy

**C.** Peroneal tendinopathy

**D.** Plantar fasciitis

**E.** Tarsal tunnel syndrome

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Peroneal tendinopathy is most commonly an overuse injury and results in tenderness along the path of the peroneal tendon from the lateral heel to the midfoot. Achilles tendinopathy involves tenderness in the posterior heel about 2â€“4 cm above the insertion of the Achilles tendon onto the calcaneus. Lisfranc arthropathy is caused by damage to the ligaments that support the midfoot and causes tenderness across the dorsal midfoot. Plantar fasciitis is characterized by pain and tenderness at the insertion of the plantar fascia on the plantar heel. Tarsal tunnel syndrome causes medial ankle pain that typically radiates to the medial midfoot.
