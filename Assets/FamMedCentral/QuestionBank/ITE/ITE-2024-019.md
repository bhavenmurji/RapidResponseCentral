# Question ITE-2024-019

## Question
A 44-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents to the urgent care clinic after he was 
noted to have a blood pressure of 175/105 mm Hg at a workplace screening event. He has not 
established medical care since relocating last year and has not been taking his previously prescribed 
medications. His blood pressure in the clinic is 189/119 mm Hg after sitting for 10 minutes and being 
positioned appropriately. He does not have chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, or vision changes. Physical examination findings are unremarkable.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management?

## Answer Choices
**A)** A urine drug screen
**B)** A stat troponin level
**C)** Reinitiation of his antihypertensive medication
**D)** Clonidine, 0.3 mg orally
**E)** Transfer to the emergency department

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient has severe asymptomatic hypertension, also known as hypertensive urgency. This condition is characterized by a systolic blood pressure of >180 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of >110 mm Hg, with no evidence of end -organ damage. Patients with this condition are often nonadherent to their routine blood pressure medications, and resuming the regimen with close follow -up is the best treatment. While alcohol, amphetamines, and cocaine can elevate blood pressure, ruling out substance abuse is no t the first step in management. It is extremely rare to find abnormalities on an EKG, a chest x -ray, or cardiac markers in asymptomatic patients and these diagnostic tests are not recommended. Acute treatment with clonidine or other oral agents to lower bl ood pressure prior to discharge does not improve outcomes. Hypertensive urgency does not require the intensive monitoring, intravenous therapy, or advanced testing available at an emergency department.
