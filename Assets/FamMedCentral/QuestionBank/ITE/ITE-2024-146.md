# Question ITE-2024-146

## Question
Which one of the following medication classes reduces heart failure –related hospitalizations in 
patients without diabetes mellitus?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Calcium channel blockers
**B)** DPP-4 inhibitors
**C)** Insulin
**D)** SGLT2 inhibitors
**E)** Statins

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
Adding an SGLT2 inhibitor to the medication regimen of patients with heart failure and without diabetes mellitus has been shown to reduce heart failure – related hospitalizations. Calcium channel blockers may have no effect or worsen heart failure. DPP-4 inhibitors can worsen the effects of heart failure. Insulin provides improved glucose control for patients with diabetes mellitus; however, it has not been independently shown to reduce heart failure –related hospitalizations. Statins are effective at reducin g cholesterol levels but have not been shown to reduce heart failure –related hospitalizations.
