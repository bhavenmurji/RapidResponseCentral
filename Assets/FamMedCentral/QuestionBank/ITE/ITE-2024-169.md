# Question ITE-2024-169

## Question
A 52 -year-old female sees you for a health maintenance examination. Which one of the following 
findings on fundoscopic examination would be most concerning for glaucoma?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Constricted retinal vessels
**B)** Dilated retinal vessels
**C)** A diminished cup to disc ratio
**D)** An elevated cup to disc ratio
**E)** Papilledema

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
Glaucoma is defined as a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve. It is often, but not always, accompanied by increased intraocular pressure. An increased cup to disc ratio (cupping) is an abnormality that is associated with glaucoma. This has been defined as a ratio >0.3 â€“0.5. Retinal vessel changes are not associated with glaucoma. Papilledema is a swelling of the optic disc that is generally caused by increased intracranial pressure.
