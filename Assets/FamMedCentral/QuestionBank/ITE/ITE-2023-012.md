# Question ITE-2023-012

A 42-year-old premenopausal female presents to your office with new-onset bilateral nipple discharge for the past 4 weeks. She describes the discharge as green and nonbloody. She has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and depression. Her current medications include the following: Atorvastatin (Lipitor) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Hydrochlorothiazide Lisinopril (Zestril) Metformin Her vital signs are unremarkable. A physical examination is significant for nonbloody green fluid expressed from the nipples. A TSH level, comprehensive metabolic panel, and CBC are all within normal range, and a serum hCG test is negative. A prolactin level is elevated at 85 ng/mL (N <30 in nonpregnant premenopausal females). Which one of her medications is most likely to cause galactorrhea? 5 7 ---

## Options

**A.** Atorvastatin

**B.** Escitalopram

**C.** Hydrochlorothiazide

**D.** Lisinopril

**E.** Metformin

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Of this patient’s medications, escitalopram is most likely to induce galactorrhea. SSRIs are responsible for 95% of medication-induced galactorrhea cases. The etiology of an elevated prolactin level <100 ng/mL is commonly medication, systemic pathology, or a microadenoma. Macroadenomas are associated with higher prolactin levels (>250 ng/mL). A normal physical examination, negative hCG level, and unremarkable TSH level, BUN level, creatinine level, and liver function tests further support a medication-induced etiology for this patient’s galactorrhea. Antihypertensives such as calcium channel blockers and methyldopa may cause galactorrhea, while diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril are not known offenders. Neither atorvastatin nor metformin are common etiologies for medication-induced hyperprolactinemia, although atorvastatin can cause gynecomastia.
