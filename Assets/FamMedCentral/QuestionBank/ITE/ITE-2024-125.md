# Question ITE-2024-125

## Question
A 12 -year-old female is brought to your clinic for a sports preparticipation evaluation for volleyball. 
Her family history is significant for a paternal grandfather with cardiovascular disease. In early 
childhood, she was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis a nd mild intermittent asthma that is controlled 
with a short -acting bronchodilator. The review of systems is unremarkable except for occasional 
shortness of breath when she is exposed to cats. On examination in a supine position, a systolic 
nonradiating mur mur is best heard over the left upper sternal border. The murmur decreases with the 
Valsalva maneuver. 
 
Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An atrial septal defect
**B)** Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
**C)** Mitral valve prolapse
**D)** A pulmonary flow murmur
**E)** Tricuspid stenosis

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
A pulmonary flow murmur is an innocent systolic harsh murmur most commonly identified in adolescents and best heard at the left upper sternal border with minimal radiation. It is reduced when the Valsalva maneuver is performed. Atrial septal defects presen t as midsystolic murmurs best heard over the left upper sternal border. They radiate to the back and start softly then intensify in sound. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy causes a midsystolic murmur heard over the left lower sternal border and apex . It is enhanced by the Valsalva maneuver. A mitral valve prolapse murmur is enhanced with the Valsalva maneuver in late systole, has a midsystolic click, and radiates to the apex. Tricuspid stenosis is a pathologic mid -diastolic murmur heard over the left lower sternal border. It increases with deep inspiration.
