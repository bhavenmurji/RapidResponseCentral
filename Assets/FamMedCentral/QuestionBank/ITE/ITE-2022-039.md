# Question ITE-2022-039

descending artery. Which one of the following is NOT appropriate first-line therapy in this patient?

## Options

**A.** Aspirin plus clopidogrel (Plavix)

**B.** Diltiazem (Cardizem)

**C.** Metoprolol

**D.** Rosuvastatin (Crestor)

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

-Blockers are first-line therapy for antihypertensive therapy and antianginal therapy, whereas calcium
channel blockers are second-line agents in patients who are unable to tolerate -blockers. Calcium channel
blockers may also be added as additional therapy when hypertension and angina symptoms are not
controlled with -blockers alone. Patients who have been treated with a drug-eluting stent require dual
antiplatelet therapy for 6â€“12 months. All patients with coronary artery disease should be on high-dose
statin therapy.
