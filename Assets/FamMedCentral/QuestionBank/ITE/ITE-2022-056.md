# Question ITE-2022-056

with ketoacidosis?

## Options

**A.** Dapagliflozin (Farxiga)

**B.** Liraglutide (Victoza)

**C.** Metformin

**D.** Pioglitazone (Actos)

**E.** Sitagliptin (Januvia)

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin have increasingly been shown to be associated with diabetic
ketoacidosis under certain circumstances. Liraglutide, metformin, pioglitazone, and sitagliptin are not
associated with diabetic ketoacidosis.
