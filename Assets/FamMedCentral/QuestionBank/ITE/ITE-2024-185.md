# Question ITE-2024-185

## Question
A 65 -year-old male sees you for follow -up after he was hospitalized for pneumonia a few months 
ago. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years. Pulmonary function testing today 
shows an FEV 1 of 60% of predicted and an FEV 1/FVC ratio of 0.65. Physical examination findings 
include a BMI of 24 kg/m2 and scattered rhonchi in the chest.  
 
Which one of the following inhalers is the recommended initial treatment to decrease this patient’s 
number of exacerbations?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort)
**B)** Fluticasone propionate
**C)** Ipratropium bromide/albuterol (Combivent Respimat)
**D)** Salmeterol (Serevent Diskus)
**E)** Tiotropium (Spiriva)

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
According to the GOLD Spirometry Classification, an FEV 1/FVC ratio <0.70 and an FEV 1 ≥50% and <80% of predicted is stage 2 COPD. Initial inhaler pharmacotherapy can be guided by the GOLD ABCD assessment that integrates symptoms and exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations require either an oral antibiotic, an oral corticosteroid, or both, while a severe exacerbation results in an emergency department visit or hospitalization. Patients with 2 or more moderate exacerbations or 1 or more hospitalizations, such as this patient, should be prescribed a long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) as first - line therapy. Monotherapy with this group of medications reduces symptoms, decreases exacerbations, and decreases hospitalizations. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) such as fluticasone propionate are not recommended as monotherapy for COPD, particularly for those who have had pneumonia. Using a long - acting β-agonist (LABA) with an ICS is less effective at reducing exacerbations and increa ses the risk for pneumonia. Monotherapy with a LABA such as salmeterol reduces exacerbations requiring hospitalization, but symptoms are better controlled when a LABA is used in combination with a LAMA. Short -acting β-adrenergic agonists and short - acting m uscarinic antagonists are appropriate for acute exacerbations rather than prevention.
