# Question ITE-2023-117

A 42-year-old male presents for evaluation of a persistent cough. Three weeks ago, he developed a runny nose, dry cough, and generalized malaise without fever. One week later, he began to develop persistent fits of coughing followed by bouts of posttussive emesis. You suspect pertussis. Which one of the following laboratory tests should be used to confirm your diagnostic suspicion? 44 46 ---

## Options

**A.** Culture

**B.** Direct fluorescent antibody assay

**C.** Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

**D.** Serology for IgG

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most rapid and accurate test to confirm pertussis and is the diagnostic test of choice (evidence rating B). Cultures are challenging to grow and results take 7â€“10 days. Direct fluorescent antibody assays have low sensitivity and specificity and are no longer used. Serology for IgG does not peak until the paroxysmal and convalescent stages, and is used primarily for epidemiologic purposes.
