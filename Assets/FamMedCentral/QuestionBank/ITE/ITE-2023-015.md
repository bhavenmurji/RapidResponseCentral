# Question ITE-2023-015

A healthy 78-year-old female with no history of osteoporosis has a family history of hip fracture. Bone density screening reveals a lumbar T-score of –2.0 and a right hip T-score of –1.5. Her FRAX score is calculated at a 20% risk of major osteoporotic fracture and an 11% risk of hip fracture. She is concerned about the possibility of breaking her hip. Which one of the following interventions would be most appropriate? 6 8 ---

## Options

**A.** Initiating treatment with a bisphosphonate

**B.** Initiating treatment with combined estrogen/progesterone

**C.** A repeat bone density scan in 1 year

**D.** A repeat bone density scan in 3 years

**E.** A repeat bone density scan in 5 years

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The National Osteoporosis Foundation supports treatment of postmenopausal women with low bone mass and a 10-year risk >20% for any major fracture or 3% for hip fracture. First-line treatment options include bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid), teriparatide, and denosumab. These medications are considered first line due to their proven efficacy in reducing both hip and vertebral fractures. Hormonal treatment such as raloxifene and hormone replacement therapy is not recommended as first-line treatment due to associated risk and side effects as well as lack of evidence supporting efficacy in preventing hip fractures. Women with a 10-year fracture risk <20% but who have osteopenia and/or risk factors for bone loss can be monitored with periodic bone density scans, though the optimal intervals for repeat evaluation have not been definitively established. 6
