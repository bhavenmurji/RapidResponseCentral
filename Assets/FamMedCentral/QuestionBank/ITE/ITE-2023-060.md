# Question ITE-2023-060

A previously healthy 30-year-old male who is a nonsmoker comes to your clinic for an acute visit because of a cough that produces yellowish phlegm. His illness started with a “cold” 10 days ago. He has no fever or chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination his vital signs are normal, and his lungs are clear bilaterally to the bases. A chest radiograph is normal. The most appropriate next step is 22 24 ---

## Options

**A.** reassurance only

**B.** amoxicillin

**C.** azithromycin (Zithromax)

**D.** doxycycline

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

Antibiotics do not show any benefit in the treatment of acute bronchitis. While patients may report previous success with antibiotics for the same condition, a Cochrane review found no difference in general improvement at follow-up between antibiotics, no treatment, and placebo. Due to the frequency of side effects of antibiotics and the problems of antibiotic resistance, the NNT Group has rated antibiotics for acute bronchitis as red on its rating system, indicating no benefits.
