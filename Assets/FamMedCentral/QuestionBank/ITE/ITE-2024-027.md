# Question ITE-2024-027

## Question
A 30 -year-old soccer player presents with a hyperextension injury of his right wrist after falling and 
landing on his outstretched hand. On examination the wrist is swollen and tender over the anatomic 
snuffbox. A plain radiograph shows soft tissue swelling.  
 
In addition to ice and elevation, which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatm ent?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Gutter splint
**B)** Thumb spica splint
**C)** Volar splint
**D)** Short arm cast
**E)** Long arm cast

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
The patient should be presumed to have a scaphoid fracture and treated with a thumb spica splint for up to 8 weeks. An initial plain radiograph may be normal in up to 20% of scaphoid fractures. Radiography can be repeated in 2 weeks if the wrist remains tender. A gutter splint, volar splint, short arm cast, and long arm cast would not be appropriate for treatment of a scaphoid fracture.
