# Question ITE-2024-129

## Question
A 39 -year-old female presents for a postpartum visit 2 months after a preterm delivery that was 
complicated by chronic hypertension and a bicornuate uterus. She does not smoke cigarettes.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most appropriate contraceptive for this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Oral levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol
**B)** An etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring (NuvaRing)
**C)** An etonogestrel subdermal implant (Nexplanon)
**D)** A levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena)
**E)** A copper IUD (Paragard)

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
This patient has a structural abnormality of the uterus and IUDs are contraindicated. Furthermore, even well -controlled hypertension is a relative contraindication to estrogen -containing contraceptives such as combination pills and the vaginal ring, due to associated vascular risks in a patient older than 35 years. Nonhormonal methods and progesterone -only contraceptive pills, depot injections, and implants remain options. The etonogestrel implant is the most effective of these options.
