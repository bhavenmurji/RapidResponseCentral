# Question ITE-2023-197

A 30-year-old security guard who runs 15–20 miles per week and works 12-hour shifts 3–4 days per week presents with a 2-week history of heel pain. The pain is especially intense when she first steps out of bed in the morning and at the end of her shift. A physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation over the medial plantar region of the heel. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial intervention at this time?

## Options

**A.** NSAIDs, stretching, and ice massage

**B.** Corticosteroid injection of the heel

**C.** Ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin injection of the heel

**D.** Extracorporeal shock wave therapy

**E.** Referral to a surgeon for plantar fasciotomy

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This is a classic presentation of plantar fasciitis. This patient is very active and is on her feet for prolonged periods of time with heel pain that is most painful when she first gets out of bed in the morning. The initial treatment for plantar fasciitis is conservative, including NSAIDs, stretching, ice massage, heel padding, and activity modification. If this is not effective, corticosteroid and botulinum toxin injections can be helpful in improving short-term pain and avoiding surgery. Studies of extracorporeal shock wave therapy have shown mixed results, but a meta-analysis of nine randomized, controlled trials concluded that this therapy may be considered after failure of traditional conservative therapy to avoid the need for surgery. Surgery is a last resort and is generally considered after all of the listed treatments have failed. Most cases of plantar fasciitis are self-limited and more than three quarters of all patients improve in 1 year.
