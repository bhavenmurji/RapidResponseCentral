# Question ITE-2024-144

## Question
A 64 -year-old male with stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) sees you for recommended follow -
up screenings. Which one of the following is most likely to be found in a patient with chronic kidney disease –mineral and bone disorder (CKD -MBD)?

## Answer Choices
**A)** An elevated 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level
**B)** An elevated calcium level
**C)** An elevated phosphate level
**D)** sees you for recommended follow - up screenings. Which one of the following is most likely to be found in a patient with chronic kidney disease –mineral and bone disorder (CKD -MB

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Screening for signs of chronic kidney disease –mineral and bone disorder (CKD -MBD) through the monitoring of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase, and possibly 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels is recommended beginning in stage 3 CKD. Early changes include the kidneys’ decreased ability to excrete phosphate. This can lead to elevated serum phosphate and PTH levels (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Decreased renal vitamin D production can lead to a lower calcium level, which also in creases the PTH level. These changes can then lead to the abnormalities of bone strength and mineralization seen in CKD -MBD.
