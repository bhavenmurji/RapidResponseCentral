# Question ITE-2022-139

follow-up. Despite her best efforts with diet and exercise, she has been unable to achieve a healthy BMI. Her current medications include metformin, lisinopril (Zestril), and atorvastatin (Lipitor). A physical examination is remarkable only for a BMI of 32 kg/m2. A hemoglobin A1c is 7.5%, which is unchanged from 3 months ago. A basic metabolic panel shows normal electrolytes and renal function. Which one of the following additional medications would be most likely to improve her glucose control and help her achieve weight loss?

## Options

**A.** Glipizide (Glucotrol)

**B.** Insulin glargine (Lantus)

**C.** Liraglutide (Victoza)

**D.** Nateglinide (Starlix)

**E.** Sitagliptin (Januvia)

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

While each of the listed medications has evidence (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) of benefit for improving glycemic control, only the
GLP-1 agonist liraglutide would be expected to cause weight loss. SGLT2 inhibitors are also associated
with weight loss. Sulfonylureas such as glipizide, insulins such as glargine, and meglitinides such as
nateglinide all increase the risk of weight gain. DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin are weight neutral.
