# Question ITE-2022-166

his developmental and social histories are unremarkable. His vital signs include a height of 152 cm (60 in), a weight of 79 kg (174 lb), a blood pressure of 133/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 85 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 14/min. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in management?

## Options

**A.** Discussing healthy lifestyle changes, with follow-up at the next annual visit

**B.** Repeating blood pressure measurements two more times during this visit

**C.** Checking blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities and starting an angiotensin

**D.** Screening for hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, and kidney disease only

**E.** Screening for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, fatty liver, and kidney disease, and referral for

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Hypertension in children up to age 12 is defined by a blood pressure at the 95th percentile or higher based
on age, height, and sex. Starting at age 13, hypertension can be defined in absolute numbers of 130/80 mm
Hg or higher. Diagnosing hypertension in children and adolescents requires careful evaluation, and it is
recommended to recheck the blood pressure twice during the same visit using auscultation and average the
values to determine the final blood pressure. If this results in a persistent hypertensive blood pressure level,
initial lifestyle modifications should be recommended, and blood pressure should be rechecked in 1â€“2
weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be considered at that time, particularly if the blood
pressure is borderline. If blood pressure remains high, a targeted evaluation for secondary hypertension
and an evaluation for hyperlipidemia, diabetes (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) mellitus, and renal disease should be performed, as well
as checking upper and lower extremity blood pres...
