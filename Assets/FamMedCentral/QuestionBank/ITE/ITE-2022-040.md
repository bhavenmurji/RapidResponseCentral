# Question ITE-2022-040

of alcohol on his breath. His Patient Health Questionnaireâ€“9 (PHQ-9) score today is 20, and his last PHQ-9 score was 7. He has a history of depression and is currently taking citalopram (Celexa). The patient is tearful during the encounter and admits to thinking the world would be better without him in it. He does not have a weapon with him but keeps a gun in an unlocked drawer in his nightstand. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point?

## Options

**A.** Avoiding direct inquiry about suicide

**B.** Calling 911

**C.** Crisis planning

**D.** Creating a suicide prevention contract

**E.** Withholding psychogenic medications

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Crisis planning is recommended for patients presenting with suicidal ideation (SOR B). By identifying
social support, local resources, and counseling services, suicidal ideation and days spent in the hospital
can be reduced. Direct inquiry about suicide is recommended to better evaluate and treat suicidal patients
with more favorable outcomes (SOR B). Though calling 911 may be appropriate for transportation for
inpatient therapy if involuntary treatment is recommended, further assessment is needed in this case.
Suicide prevention contracts do not effectively prevent suicide (SOR B). Psychogenic medications should
not be withheld when treating a patient with suicidal ideation. Evidence has shown that the combination
of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is most effective (SOR C).
