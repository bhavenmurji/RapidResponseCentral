## Options

**A.** A 24-hour urine collection for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)

**B.** A serum aldosterone/renin ratio

**C.** A serum cortisol level

**D.** A serum cystatin C level

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) hyperaldosteronism should be suspected as a cause for hypertension if a patient has a
spontaneously low potassium level or persistent hypertension despite the use of three or more
antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic. This can be evaluated by checking a serum renin
activity level and a serum aldosterone concentration and determining the aldosterone/renin ratio. Primary
hyperaldosteronism typically presents with a very low serum renin activity level and an elevated serum
aldosterone concentration. A 24-hour urine collection for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) would be
used to evaluate for a neuroendocrine tumor, which can present as chronic flushing and diarrhea. Cortisol
levels can be checked if Cushing syndrome is suspected. Hypertension can be present in Cushing
syndrome, but it is typically associated with other signs such as obesity and an elevated blood glucose level
due to insulin resistance. Cystatin C is a marker of renal function and measurement would...
