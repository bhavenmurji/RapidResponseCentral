# Question ITE-2022-096

reports gradual leaking of urine over the past year. It mostly occurs when she does strength training at the gym and has become so bothersome that she has limited her exercise. She also notices leaking when coughing, sneezing, and picking up her young children. Her BMI is 27 kg/m2. A pelvic examination is notable for a normal urethral body and thick, pink vulvar tissue. The vaginal vault is without prolapse. You ask her to cough with a full bladder and note leakage of urine. A urinalysis is normal. You counsel her on appropriate fluid intake, timed voiding, the reduction of caffeinated and carbonated beverages, regular moderate physical activity, and weight loss. In addition to these behavioral modifications, which one of the following is the most appropriate intervention at this time?

## Options

**A.** An oral antimuscarinic agent

**B.** Intravaginal estrogen

**C.** OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)

**D.** Pelvic floor muscle training

**E.** Urethropexy

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

The cough stress test confirms that this patient is experiencing chronic stress urinary incontinence. In
addition to other behavioral modifications such as appropriate fluid intake, timed voiding, the reduction
of caffeinated and carbonated beverages, regular moderate physical activity, and weight loss, pelvic floor
muscle training is a first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence. There are no FDA-approved oral
medications for the treatment of stress incontinence. Oral antimuscarinic agents and onabotulinumtoxinA
are approved for use in urge incontinence. Intravaginal estrogen can be used to treat underlying vaginal
and vulvar atrophy that can contribute to urinary incontinence, but it has not been approved by the FDA
for the treatment of urinary incontinence. This patient does not have concurrent atrophic vaginitis so she
would not be an appropriate candidate for intravaginal estrogen. Surgical intervention with urethropexy
or sling procedures can be considered if conservativ...
