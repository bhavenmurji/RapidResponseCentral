# Question ITE-2024-085

## Question
A 68 -year-old male with coronary artery disease, major depression, and hypertension presents for 
routine follow -up. He currently smokes a half -pack of cigarettes per day and asks what options are 
available to help with smoking cessation.  
 
Which one of the following would be the most effective treatment for smoking cessation?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Bupropion (Wellbutrin SR) only
**B)** Varenicline only
**C)** Bupropion plus nicotine gum (Nicorette Gum)
**D)** Varenicline plus nicotine gum
**E)** The nicotine patch (Nicoderm CQ) plus nicotine gum

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
There are several pharmaceutical options available to aid in smoking cessation. Varenicline is the most effective medical option and is safe in patients with mental health conditions. Current evidence suggests that the addition of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to varenicline improves smoking cessation rates. Both NRT and bupropion are effective for smoking cessation, but are not as effective as varenicline. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend a combination of NRT and bupropion.
