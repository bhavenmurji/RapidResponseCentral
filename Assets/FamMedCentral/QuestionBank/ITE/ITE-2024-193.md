# Question ITE-2024-193

## Question
A 29 -year-old female presents with low back pain that began after giving birth 3 months ago. She 
reports pain on her right side when climbing and descending stairs and when lying on her right side. 
On examination she has mild lumbar paraspinal muscle tightness on the left and moderate tenderness inferomedial to the posterior superior iliac spine on the right. Muscle strength testing and lower 
extremity reflexes are normal.  
 
Which one of the following conditions is the most likely cause of this patient’s pain?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Lumbar strain
**B)** Piriformis syndrome
**C)** Pudendal nerve entrapment
**D)** Sacroiliac joint dysfunction
**E)** Spondyloarthropathy

## Correct Answer
**D**

## Explanation
Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is commonly seen in primary care and is an important consideration in the evaluation of low back pain. It often occurs during pregnancy and post partum. Other inciting incidents include a motor vehicle accident or a mechanical fall onto the buttocks. It can be associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies; however, the etiology in this case is more likely to be childbirth. Symptoms often include pain at the sacroiliac joint that worsens with climbing sta irs, lying on the affected side, prolonged standing and sitting, and weight -bearing on the leg of the affected side. Examination findings include tenderness that is inferomedial to the posterior superior iliac spine. A number of provocation tests for sacro iliac joint dysfunction can help to confirm the diagnosis. NSAIDs, physical therapy, and joint manipulation are first -line treatments. Pelvic belts, corticosteroid injections, and sacroiliac joint fusion are used for refractory cases. Lumbar strain is in the differential diagnosis, but sacroiliac joint dysfunction is more likely given this patient’s history and the duration and location of tenderness. Piriformis syndrome is usually unilateral and causes sciatic -like symptoms. Pudendal n erve entrapment would cause perineal pain or labial numbness. Spondyloarthropathies are associated with sacroiliac joint inflammation but are not as likely in this postpartum patient .
