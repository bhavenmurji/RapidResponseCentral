# Question ITE-2023-143

A 51-year-old male presents to your office with right arm weakness. He has a history of multiple sclerosis (MS) with infrequent flares only. His MS is managed with interferon as the long-term disease-modifying therapy. After a thorough history and examination, you diagnose a flare of MS. In addition to notifying his neurologist, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step? 53 55 ---

## Options

**A.** Doubling his dosage of interferon for 5 days

**B.** Initiating high-dose aspirin

**C.** Initiating corticosteroids

**D.** Ordering plasmapheresis

**E.** Referral to physical therapy

## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Although multiple sclerosis (MS) is often managed by a neurologist and a multidisciplinary team, family physicians sometimes see these patients for symptoms that could be related to their disease process. If an MS flare is thought to be the etiology, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice, most often oral methylprednisolone with recommendations of 500 mg daily for 5 days or 1000 mg daily for 3 days. Intravenous administration has not been found to be more efficacious than oral administration. Corticosteroids speed the recovery process but do not generally alter the long-term outcomes. Patients without an adequate response to the corticosteroid burst may potentially benefit from plasmapheresis. High-dose interferon, high-dose aspirin, and physical therapy are not used to treat acute exacerbations.
