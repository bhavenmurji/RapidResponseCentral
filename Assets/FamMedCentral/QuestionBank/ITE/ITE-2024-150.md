# Question ITE-2024-150

## Question
A 54 -year-old postmenopausal female with a past medical history of hypertension, nicotine 
dependence, and obesity sees you to establish care. Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, 
losartan (Cozaar), and metformin. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and drinks 1 glass of wine 
each night. She returns 1 week later to discuss the results of laboratory studies.  
 The laboratory studies demonstrate a positive hepatitis C antibody. Reflex testing reveals hepatitis C 
virus genotype and a hepatitis C viral load of 253,351 IU/mL. The AST level, ALT level, creatinine 
level, and INR are within normal limits. Tests for HIV, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B are negative. You calculate a Fibrosis -4 (FIB -4) score of 0.93,  indicating a lack of advanced fibrosis. You initiate 
vaccination for hepatitis A and B.  
 Which one of the following would be the most appropriate timing to initiate treatment with 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret)?

## Answer Choices
**A)** At this visit
**B)** After she has abstained from alcohol for 3 months
**C)** If a repeat hepatitis C viral load is increased in 3 months
**D)** After completing the hepatitis A and B vaccination series
**E)** If a Doppler ultrasound of the liver is negative for a hepatic vein thrombosis

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have never received treatment and do not have cirrhosis or have compensated cirrhosis. Limiting alcohol use is important to decrease the risk for cirrhosis, but cessation is not necessary in those undergoing treatment for HCV infection. Further hepatitis C viral load testing in 3 months is not the most appropriate next step for this patient. While vaccinations are important, the hepatitis A and B series do not need to be completed prior to initiating treatment. Further imaging is not indicated for this patient given her low Fibrosis -4 (FIB-4) score, which indicates a very low likelihood of cirrhosis.
