# Question ITE-2024-044

## Question
A 55 -year-old female presents to your office because of a several -month history of progressively 
worsening fatigue, weakness, and unexplained weight loss. Physical examination findings are 
remarkable for hyperpigmentation of the skin and buccal mucosa. Initial laboratory studies reveal a 
low morning cortisol level.  
 
Which one of the foll owing is the most likely diagnosis?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Addison disease
**B)** Cushing disease
**C)** Pheochromocytoma
**D)** Primary hyperaldosteronism
**E)** Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
Addison disease is usually marked by fatigue, weakness, unexplained weight loss, and hyperpigmentation along with low cortisol levels. Hyperpigmentation is the result of elevated levels of melanocyte -stimulating hormone, a cleavage product of corticotropin (ACTH). Cushing disease is the result of excessive cortisol production due to a corticotropin -secreting pituitary adenoma and is marked by weight gain, central obesity, moon facies, buffalo hump, and muscle weakness. Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine -secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla. It usually presents with episodic symptoms, including hypertension, headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Primary hyperaldosteronism is due to excessive aldosterone production leading to sodium retention, potassium loss, and hypertension. Clinical features of primary hyperaldosteronism include hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is caused by the inappropriate release of vasopressin despi te normal or increased plasma volume and may be triggered by stroke, infection, trauma, medications, pulmonary disease, or HIV. Clinical symptoms of SIADH include confusion, muscle weakness, tremor, muscle cramps, hallucinations, seizures, and death.
