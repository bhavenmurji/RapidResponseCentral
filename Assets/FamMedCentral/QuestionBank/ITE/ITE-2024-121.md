# Question ITE-2024-121

## Question
While performing a mental status examination, you request that the patient spell “world” backward. 
This test assesses which one of the following mental status components?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Attention
**B)** Executive function
**C)** Memory
**D)** Orientation
**E)** Visuospatial proficiency

## Correct Answer
**A**

## Explanation
The mental status examination is used to differentiate among conditions such as delirium, dementia, mania, and depression. The components of the mental status examination include attention, executive function, memory, orientation, and visuospatial proficie ncy. Attention is assessed by asking the patient to spell a word backward or count backward by 7s or 5s. Drawing a clock face with the hands at the 11:10 position tests for executive function. Memory is tested by asking the patient to repeat 3 words, allowing 5 minutes to elapse, and then asking the patient to recall the words. Orientation is assessed by asking the year, day, time, location, or name. Visuospatial proficiency is tested by requesting that the patient copy intersecting pentagons or a 3 - dimensi onal cube on paper. Another option is to draw a triangle and request that the patient draw the same shape upside down.
