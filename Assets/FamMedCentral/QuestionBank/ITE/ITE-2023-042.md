# Question ITE-2023-042

A 35-year-old female presents with a 4-month history of pain in her neck, chest, mid and lower back, hip, and right leg. She has difficulty falling asleep at night and does not feel refreshed upon awakening in the morning. She feels like she is not as mentally sharp as she used to be and feels mildly depressed at times. A physical examination is notable for multiple soft-tissue tender points without evidence of joint deformity, inflammation, or erythema. Which one of the following would be appropriate first-line pharmacologic therapy for this patientâ€™s condition? 15 17 ---

## Options

**A.** Amitriptyline

**B.** Celecoxib (Celebrex)

**C.** Hydrocodone

**D.** Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)

**E.** Naproxen

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

This patient meets diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia, which is characterized by diffuse, chronic pain without evidence of inflammation, erythema, or joint deformities. Pharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia include tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, SNRIs such as duloxetine and milnacipran, and gabapentinoids such as pregabalin. Evidence does not show benefit from NSAIDs such as celecoxib or naproxen or opioids such as hydrocodone. Hydroxychloroquine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic agent used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and malaria and is not appropriate for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
