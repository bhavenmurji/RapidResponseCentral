# Question ITE-2023-181

A 60-year-old female presents to the emergency department after developing confusion with severe headache and nausea. Shortly after arrival she has a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting less than 30 seconds. She has a blood pressure of 220/130 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 85 beats/min, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiac enzymes are negative. Noncontrast CT of the head is negative for hemorrhage and contrast CT of the chest and abdomen reveals no aortic dissection. Based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the patient’s blood pressure is lowered by approximately 20% during the first hour of treatment. Assuming the patient remains clinically stable, the goal over the next 2–6 hours is to lower her blood pressure to 66 68 ---

## Options

**A.** 130/90 mm Hg

**B.** 140/90 mm Hg

**C.** 150/100 mm Hg

**D.** 160/100 mm Hg

**E.** 170/100 mm Hg

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

This patient is having a hypertensive emergency with encephalopathy and the goal is to lower her blood pressure by no more than 25% in the first hour. Over the next 2–6 hours, her blood pressure should be lowered to 160/100 mm Hg. After that level is achieved, her blood pressure may be cautiously lowered to normal over the ensuing 24–48 hours. Lowering blood pressure too aggressively can lead to cerebral ischemia and should be avoided.
