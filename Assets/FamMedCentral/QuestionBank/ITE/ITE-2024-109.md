# Question ITE-2024-109

## Question
A 26-year-old nulliparous female presents for an evaluation after she discovered a breast mass while 
showering. An examination confirms a 4 × 3- cm nonpainful mass in the upper outer quadrant of the 
right breast.  
 
Which one of the following should you recomme nd?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Screening mammography of the breast
**B)** Diagnostic mammography of the breast
**C)** Ultrasonography of the breast
**D)** MRI of the breast
**E)** Surgical referral for excision and biopsy

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Diagnostic mammography is typically the preferred imaging modality for a palpable breast mass. However, ultrasonography is more sensitive in women younger than 30 years of age and is preferred. Screening mammography should be performed biennially for asymp tomatic women ages 40−74. MRI is not appropriate for this patient at this time. Surgical excision and biopsy would be necessary if abnormalities are found on imaging.
