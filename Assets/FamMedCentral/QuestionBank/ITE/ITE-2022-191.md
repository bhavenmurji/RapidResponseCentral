# Question ITE-2022-191

pain that was diagnosed as costochondritis. He has a history of hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. A CBC in the ED was significant for a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL (N 13.5–17.5) and a mean corpuscular volume of 104 μm3 (N 80–100). Follow-up laboratory studies showed the following: Peripheral smear                        normal other than macrocytosis Reticulocyte index                      1.7% (N 0.5–2.5) Vitamin B12                           512 pg/mL (N 190–950) Folate                               12 pg/mL (N 2.7–17) Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s anemia?

## Options

**A.** Anemia of chronic disease

**B.** Chronic alcohol use

**C.** Gastrointestinal bleeding

**D.** Hemolysis

**E.** Myelodysplastic syndrome

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Chronic alcohol use is one of the most common causes of macrocytic anemia. This patient’s normal
peripheral smear and reticulocyte index (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-index.md|2023 05 Index]]) <2% in the setting of anemia suggest decreased red blood cell
production, which may be related to alcohol use or nutritional deficiency. Vitamin B12 and folate levels in
the normal range rule out deficiencies in these vitamins, though patients with low-normal vitamin B12 and
folate levels may warrant testing of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels. Anemia of chronic
disease is typically characterized by a normocytic or microcytic anemia and a low reticulocyte count. Blood
loss and hemolytic anemia are typically associated with a reticulocyte index >2%. Myelodysplastic
syndrome is not suggested by the peripheral smear and is less common than anemia related to alcohol use
disorder.
