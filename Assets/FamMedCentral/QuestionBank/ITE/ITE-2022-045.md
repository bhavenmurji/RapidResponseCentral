# Question ITE-2022-045

tremor resolves if he is touched on the hand by someone. His wife notes that he seems to drag his feet now, but he has no history of falls. Which one of the following has been shown to delay progression of his disease?

## Options

**A.** No currently available pharmacologic agents

**B.** Amantadine

**C.** Carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet)

**D.** Rasagiline (Azilect)

**E.** Ropinirole

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

There are no currently available medications that have been shown to delay progression of Parkinsonâ€™s
disease. However, guidelines recommend initiating the treatment of motor symptoms when they begin to
affect the functions of daily life or decrease the quality of life. The first-line treatment for motor symptoms
is carbidopa/levodopa due to its effectiveness for tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It is a myth that
delaying the use of levodopa will prevent a lack of efficacy later in the course of the illness, as what
appears to be a lack of efficacy actually represents progression of the disease.
Amantadine can be used for patients under 65 years of age who are only experiencing tremors. Monoamine
oxidase inhibitors such as rasagiline and non-ergot dopamine agonists such as ropinirole are not as effective
as carbidopa/levodopa for motor symptoms, but they do not cause the dyskinesias and motor fluctuations
seen with levodopa. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are considered first-line th...
