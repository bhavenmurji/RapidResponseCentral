# Question ITE-2023-110

A 35-year-old female presents to your office after a recent trip to Brazil. She tells you that she has developed an extremely pruritic rash that started on her face and has spread to her trunk and limbs. In addition, she reports a headache, arthralgias, and myalgias. On examination you note a diffuse scarlatiniform rash, conjunctivitis, and small petechiae on the palate. She is afebrile. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Chikungunya virus

**B.** Dengue virus

**C.** West Nile virus

**D.** Yellow fever

**E.** Zika virus

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Zika virus, an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, is most frequently found in tropical regions and is spread by the female Aedes species mosquito. While Zika virus infection shares many of the same symptoms as the other viruses listed, it often has no fever and the rash is accompanied by severe pruritus and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection typically develops 3–12 days following a bite by the Aedes species mosquito and the symptoms last between a few days to 1 week. The disease is typically self-limited and does not require hospitalization. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause infants to be born with microcephaly and other congenital malformations, known as congenital Zika syndrome. Infection with Zika virus is also associated with miscarriage and preterm birth. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation but may be confirmed with serologic testing. Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever are also spread by mosquitos but have slightly different clinical presentations. Chikungunya virus is an RNA virus in the Togaviridae family that is characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, and is frequently accompanied by debilitating joint pain that usually lasts for a few days, but may prolong for weeks, months, or even years. Like Zika virus, dengue virus is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family spread by the Aedes species mosquito. The incubation period varies from 4 to 10 days and common symptoms include a high fever (40°C [104°F]) that is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms: headaches, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, joint, bone or muscle pains, and rash. West Nile virus is an RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family and is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. The incubation period varies from 3 to 14 days. Symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness and body aches, nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph glands, and sometimes a skin rash on the trunk. 43  Yellow fever is an RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. Incubation time for the virus is 3–6 days. The most common symptoms are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3–4 days, but a small minority of patients become quite ill.
