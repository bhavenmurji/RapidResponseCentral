# Question ITE-2022-050

thigh. She was seen at an urgent care facility 2 days ago for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim). Her UTI symptoms have improved. She reports that she was called earlier this morning and told that her infection was caused by Escherichia coli . The patient reports a similar lesion in the same area about a year ago at the time of her last UTI. You explain this is most likely secondary to

## Options

**A.** an immunologic reaction to E. coli

**B.** erythema multiforme

**C.** nummular eczema

**D.** the Shiga toxin sometimes produced by E. coli

**E.** the sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim used to treat the infection

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

This is a typical history for a fixed drug eruption (FDE), which is an immunologic reaction that recurs
upon re-exposure to the offending drug. It is most likely related to T-lymphocytes at the dermal-epidermal
junction. Sulfonamides and anticonvulsants are the most frequently cited medications, but tetracycline and
penicillins have also been reported to cause FDE. FDE is not caused by bacteria. Erythema multiforme
does not present as an isolated, recurrent macule and generally has central clearing. Nummular eczema
is a coin-shaped, very pruritic patch but does not fit this clinical scenario. Shiga toxinâ€“producing
Escherichia coli  are rarely found in extra-intestinal sites.
