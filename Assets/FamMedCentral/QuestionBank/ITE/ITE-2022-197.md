# Question ITE-2022-197

in a patient with an acute knee injury?

## Options

**A.** Age <30

**B.** Injury from a fall or blunt trauma

**C.** A twisting mechanism of injury

**D.** Inability to flex the knee to 90°

**E.** The presence of a joint effusion within 24 hours of the injury

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Knee injuries are an extremely common cause for primary (see [[Articles/2023/2023-05-diabetes-management-primary-care.md|Diabetes Management in Primary Care: Evidence-Based Approaches]]) care visits and knowing which injuries require
radiography can ensure high-value care. The Ottawa knee rule has been repeatedly validated with a
sensitivity of 98.5%–100% and can decrease unnecessary imaging. The major criteria of the Ottawa knee
rule are age 55, the inability to bear weight for four steps both immediately after the injury and at the
time of the examination, the inability to flex the knee to 90°, tenderness over the head of the fibula, and
isolated tenderness to the patella without other bony tenderness. If a patient meets any of these criteria,
radiography of the knee may be indicated.
