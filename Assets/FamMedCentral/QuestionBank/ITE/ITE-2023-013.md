# Question ITE-2023-013

A 73-year-old female with a history of obesity, essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department (ED) with severe, crushing chest pain. She has a blood pressure of 115/64 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 90 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 15/min, a temperature of 37.2°C (99.0°F), and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. A point-of-care troponin level is 1.0 ng/mL (N <0.04) and an EKG is normal, and you diagnose a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Which one of the following interventions in the ED has the greatest benefit with regard to decreasing mortality in this patient?

## Options

**A.** Supplemental oxygen

**B.** Aspirin

**C.** Metoprolol

**D.** Morphine

**E.** Nitroglycerin

## Answer

**B**

## Explanation

Based on a large, randomized, multicenter trial with 17,187 participants, the administration of aspirin for suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI) saves one life for every 24 patients. Supplemental oxygen appears to have no benefit in patients with an oxygen saturation >94%. Excessive oxygen can be toxic to endothelial cells and may decrease coronary blood flow and increase systemic vascular resistance. -Blockers given immediately after MI do not decrease mortality, likely due to increased cardiogenic shock, although -blockers administered in the subacute period following the event do have benefit. Morphine does not appear to have benefit and may increase mortality. The use of nitroglycerin does not lower the risk of mortality. 5
