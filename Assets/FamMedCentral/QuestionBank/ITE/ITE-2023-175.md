# Question ITE-2023-175

A 35-year-old female presents for contraceptive counseling. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago and she had unprotected sex 2 days ago. A pregnancy test is negative. Which one of the following would be the most effective emergency contraceptive agent for this patient?

## Options

**A.** Oral levonorgestrel (Plan B One-Step)

**B.** Oral ulipristal (Ella)

**C.** Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera)

**D.** An etonogestrel subdermal implant (Nexplanon)

**E.** A copper IUD (Paragard)

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception with a pregnancy rate of 0.1%, followed by oral ulipristal with a pregnancy rate of 1.3%. Oral levonorgestrel is less effective than both with a pregnancy rate of 2.5%. Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate and the etonogestrel subdermal implant are not recommended as emergency contraceptives.
