# Question ITE-2022-169

sustained earlier that day when she fell off her bike onto a gravel driveway. Her immunizations are up to date, including Tdap vaccination last year. A physical examination reveals an irregular, superficial abrasion measuring roughly 1Ã—2 cm, containing dirt and stony debris. Which one of the following infection prevention measures would be most appropriate in this situation?

## Options

**A.** Irrigation with tap water

**B.** Irrigation with 3% hydrogen peroxide

**C.** A topical antibiotic

**D.** An oral antibiotic

**E.** A tetanus booster

## Answer

**A**

## Explanation

The most important aspect of infection prevention in treating a superficial wound is cleaning and irrigation.
Studies have shown that irrigation with tap water provides similar outcomes compared to sterile saline
(SOR B). Antiseptic solutions such as hydrogen peroxide are no more effective than tap water, can be
caustic to wound tissue, and may delay healing (SOR C). Antibiotics should be used for treatment of
wound infections; however, non-infected wounds do not routinely require antibiotic prophylaxis unless
there is an increased risk of infection. Risk factors for wound infection include bite wounds, delayed
presentation, retained foreign material, insufficient cleaning, puncture or crush wounds, open fractures,
significant immunocompromise, and joint, cartilage, or tendon involvement. Patients with three or more
doses of tetanus toxoid with the most recent vaccination within the past 5 years do not require a tetanus
booster or tetanus immune globulin for prophylaxis, regardless of ...
