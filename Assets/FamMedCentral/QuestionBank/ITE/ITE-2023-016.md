# Question ITE-2023-016

Which one of the following tests has the highest negative predictive value to rule out celiac disease?

## Options

**A.** An antigliadin antibody test

**B.** A C-reactive protein level

**C.** A fecal calprotectin level

**D.** Genetic testing for HLA-DQ2  and HLA-DQ8

**E.** An IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody test

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

Celiac disease occurs almost exclusively in people with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 genotypes. Though not routinely performed, a negative result has more than a 99% negative predictive value for the disease. A positive IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody test is helpful in making a diagnosis if symptoms are present and has 95% sensitivity and specificity for active disease, but a negative IgA tTG test does not rule out future risk. A negative antigliadin antibody test has lower sensitivity and specificity than IgA tTG, and is used to diagnose the disease in the presence of symptoms rather than to rule out future risk. Negative C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin levels make active inflammatory bowel disease less likely.
