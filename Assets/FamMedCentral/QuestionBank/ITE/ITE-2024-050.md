# Question ITE-2024-050

## Question
A 36 -year-old female presents with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and 3 
miscarriages. She is not currently pregnant. She was recently discharged from the hospital with her 
second deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the past several y ears. A workup for the underlying cause of 
her thrombophilia is positive for antiphospholipid antibodies.  
 Which one of the following medications would be most appropriate for the long- term treatment of 
this patientâ€™s DVT?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Apixaban (Eliquis)
**B)** Aspirin
**C)** Clopidogrel (Plavix)
**D)** Enoxaparin (Lovenox)
**E)** Warfarin

## Correct Answer
**E**

## Explanation
The correct treatment of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome is warfarin. Most DVTs can be treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). DOACs may be acceptable in low -risk patients with a single previous DVT, but th ey are not preferred for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome due to the risk for increased arterial thrombotic events. Aspirin is clearly not appropriate in a patient with recurrent DVTs. Clopidogrel would never be indicated for the treatment of a DVT. If this patient were pregnant, enoxaparin would be preferred. Thrombophilia evaluation should not be considered in patients with a provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, in select patients with recurrent VTE, evaluation should be considered, specifically when the results of the testing would influence the treatment plan (SOR A). Thrombophilia testing may be considered in patients who are interested in stopping anticoagulation because of concerns such as bleeding risk, intolerance, or cost. These patients include those with an initial VTE before age 50, a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, a first -degree relative who had an initial VTE before 50 years of age, recurrent VTEs, arterial and venous thrombi, or VTE in an unusual site.
