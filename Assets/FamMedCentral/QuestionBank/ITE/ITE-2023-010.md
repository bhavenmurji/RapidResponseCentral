# Question ITE-2023-010

A Black female presents with multiple insect bites on her arms and legs. This patient is at risk for developing which one of the following conditions? 4 6 ---

## Options

**A.** Acanthosis nigricans

**B.** Acne keloidalis nuchae

**C.** Dermatosis papulosa nigra

**D.** Melasma

**E.** Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation

## Answer

**E**

## Explanation

Patients with dark skin are at greater risk for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, a reactive hypermelanosis. These are irregular hyperpigmented macules or patches that can occur after endogenous inflammation (e.g., acne vulgaris, pseudofolliculitis barbae, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, psoriasis, contact dermatitis) and external injuries (e.g., insect bites, chemical peels, cryotherapy, laser surgery). This condition can occur at any age and is particularly noticeable in Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III, IV, V, and VI. Fitzpatrick skin phototype is used to classify the skin color spectrum and is based on an individual’s propensity for sunburn (photodermatitis). It is not a surrogate marker for race or ethnicity. Broad-spectrum, water-based sunscreen with SPF 30 should be used to prevent postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (SOR C). Sunscreen that blocks visible light such as iron oxide is also useful. Acanthosis nigricans, acne keloidalis nuchae, dermatosis papulosa nigra, and melasma are conditions that are also more common in skin of color. However, they are not related to external injuries such as insect bites. Acanthosis nigricans are usually on the posterior neck, axillae, and groin. These are velvety, irregularly defined, hyperpigmented patches. Acne keloidalis nuchae occur in the nuchal and occipital scalp. These are keloid-like papules, plaques, and cicatricial alopecia. Dermatosis papulosa nigra is usually on the face and neck. They are hyperpigmented, filiform, or sessile papules. Melasma are gray-brown patches that usually occur on the face. 4
