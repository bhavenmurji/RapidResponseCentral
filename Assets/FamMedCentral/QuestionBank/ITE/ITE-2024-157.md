# Question ITE-2024-157

## Question
A 46-year-old male sends you a message in the patient portal asking how to prevent acute altitude 
sickness during his upcoming ski trip. He has no significant medical history and no previous history 
of altitude sickness. He will be sleeping at a resort locat ed at an altitude of 3000 m (9843 ft) above 
sea level and the slopes have a peak altitude of 4500 m (14,764 ft) above sea level.  He plans to start 
skiing the day after arrival and does not have time to gradually acclimatize to the change in altitude.  
 
Whic h one of the following would be most appropriate regarding the prevention of altitude sickness?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Overhydration to dilute the urine
**B)** Full genome sequencing to identify alleles associated with altitude sickness
**C)** Acetazolamide, 125 mg twice daily
**D)** Dexamethasone, 6 mg daily
**E)** Ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily

## Correct Answer
**C**

## Explanation
Altitude sickness is possible with rapid ascent to altitudes over 2500 m (8202 ft) above sea level. Slow ascent is usually recommended, but it is not often feasible for recreational winter athletes. Acetazolamide is the mainstay of pharmaceutical prophylax is if a patient desires medication. Other actions such as avoiding alcohol and increasing hydration are often recommended but are not well supported. No genetic alleles have been identified that confer increased risk for altitude sickness. Dexamethasone ca n be used to prevent and treat severe high -altitude pulmonary edema, but it is not recommended as a first -line prevention in patients such as this. Ibuprofen has been proposed as an alternative prophylactic agent, but studies have shown it to be inferior t o acetazolamide.
