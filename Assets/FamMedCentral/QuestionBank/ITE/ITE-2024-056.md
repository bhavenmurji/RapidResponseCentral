# Question ITE-2024-056

## Question
A 23 -year-old kindergarten teacher presents with a 2 -day history of fever up to 102 °F, a sore throat, 
headache, and swollen glands. She has not had a runny nose or cough. Her throat is hyperemic and 
has tonsillar exudates. The anterior cervical nodes are enlarged and tender, but there is no other 
lymphadenopathy. She requests an antibiotic to prevent complications and to reduce the likelihood of 
spreading the infection to her students. A throat swab for group A Streptococcus  is positive.  
 
Which one of the following is true regarding the use of antibiotics in this patient?

## Answer Choices
**A)** Her current symptoms will not be reduced
**B)** Her risk for developing poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis will not change
**C)** Her risk for developing rheumatic fever will not change
**D)** She will remain contagious for 7 –10 days even with treatment

## Correct Answer
**B**

## Explanation
Up to 90% of cases of pharyngitis in adults are viral in etiology. The patient in this clinical scenario, however, has a high clinical likelihood of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABS) pharyngitis, as she meets 4 of the 5 Modified Centor Criteria (fever, hyperemic/exudative tonsillitis, cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough). Antibiotic treatment is recommended to reduce communicability, relieve symptoms, and help prevent rheumatic fever (SOR C). Antibiotic treatment for GABS pharyngitis does not lower the risk for acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The use of the Modified Centor Criteria for acute pharyngitis is endorsed by both the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians.
