# Question ITE-2022-124

has persisted for several weeks. He is otherwise asymptomatic. A thorough history and physical examination does not provide any additional clues. Gastrointestinal and ear, nose, and throat etiologies are considered and are not thought to be the cause. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs are normal. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

## Options

**A.** Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing

**B.** A sputum smear for acid-fast bacillus

**C.** Sputum cytology

**D.** CT of the chest

**E.** Bronchoscopy

## Answer

**D**

## Explanation

A chest radiograph is appropriate in the initial evaluation of hemoptysis (SOR C). If the chest radiograph
does not indicate a cause, then CT or CT angiography with intravenous contrast should be performed (SOR
C). CT has become the preferred modality over bronchoscopy because it is more effective in determining
the etiology. If CT does not identify the cause, bronchoscopy would be the next step. In addition, other
tests including a sputum Gram stain, acid-fast bacillus smear, or sputum cytology can be useful depending
upon the clinical situation.
If there are concerns about the possibility of immunologic, rheumatologic, or vasculitic disease, testing
for immunologic antibodies such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) can be ordered.
