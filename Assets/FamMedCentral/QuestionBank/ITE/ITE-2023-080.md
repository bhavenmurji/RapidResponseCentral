# Question ITE-2023-080

A 20-year-old college football player becomes disoriented and weak during an afternoon practice in the heat. On the field, he is sweaty and tachycardic, with a core (rectal) temperature of

## Options



## Answer

**C**

## Explanation

Urgent alleviation of hyperthermia is the primary objective in the treatment of heatstroke. Treatment should be started in the field with immersion in cold water or, if this is not an option, pouring copious amounts of water on the patient and fanning. No pharmacologic agents are indicated for temperature reduction in this situation, and acetaminophen and aspirin may exacerbate coagulopathy and liver injury in this situation. Infusion of cold fluids would be one of the treatments of choice in elderly patients with classic heatstroke. Transfer to an emergency facility would not be the most important initial step for this patient since treatment should be started on the field.
