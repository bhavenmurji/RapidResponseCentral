class ProtocolSession: ObservableObject {
    deinit {
        timer?.invalidate()
        timer = nil
        eventLog.removeAll()
        selectedNode = nil
    }
}

// 2. Implement weak references in closures
.onDisappear {
    [weak self] in
    self?.cleanupSession()
}

// 3. Add memory leak detection in development
#if DEBUG
private func detectMemoryLeaks() {
    // Monitor memory growth patterns
    // Alert developers to potential leaks
}
#endif
```

### Medium-Term Optimizations (2-3 sprints):
1. **Protocol Preloading**: Cache commonly accessed protocols
2. **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for protocol icons
3. **Background Processing**: Move heavy operations off main thread
