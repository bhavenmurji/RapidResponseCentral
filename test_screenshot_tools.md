# Testing MCP Screenshot Tools

This document tracks attempts to identify and use MCP screenshot functionality.

## Tool Name Tests

### Test 1: Standard XcodeBuildMCP patterns
- `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__screenshot`
- `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__take_screenshot` 
- `mcp__XcodeBuildMCP__capture_screenshot`

### Test 2: Generic MCP patterns
- `mcp__screenshot`
- `mcp__take_screenshot`
- `mcp__capture_screenshot`

### Test 3: Simple function names
- `screenshot`
- `Screenshot`
- `take_screenshot`

### Test 4: Simulator-specific patterns
- `mcp__simulator__screenshot`
- `mcp__ios_simulator__screenshot`

## Test Results
[Will be updated as tests are performed]

## Current Strategy
Since I cannot identify the exact tool name, I will:
1. Focus on analyzing the code structure for compliance issues
2. Provide feedback based on code analysis
3. Create visual compliance reports
4. Document issues that would be visible in screenshots
5. Provide recommendations for UI improvements

## Code-Based Analysis Approach
Instead of screenshots, I can:
- Analyze view hierarchy and layout constraints
- Identify potential scrolling issues from code
- Validate component sizing and positioning
- Check for emoji usage in text strings
- Review layout proportions in code
- Examine arrow/connector implementations
